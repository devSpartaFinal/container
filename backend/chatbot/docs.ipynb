API Reference Built-in React Hooks Hooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React. State Hooks State lets a component “remember” information like user input. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index. To add state to a component, use one of these Hooks: useState declares a state variable that you can update directly. useReducer declares a state variable with the update logic\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='selected image index. To add state to a component, use one of these Hooks: useState declares a state variable that you can update directly. useReducer declares a state variable with the update logic inside a reducer function. <code_snipet> function ImageGallery() { const [index, setIndex] = useState(0); // ... </code_snipet> Context Hooks Context lets a component receive information from distant parents without passing it as props. For example, your app’s top-level component can pass the current UI theme to all components below, no matter how deep. useContext reads and subscribes to a context. <code_snipet> function Button() { const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); // ... </code_snipet> Ref Hooks Refs let a component hold some information that isn’t used for rendering, like a DOM node or a timeout ID. Unlike with state, updating a ref does not re-render your component. Refs are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. They are useful when you need to work with non-React systems, such as the built-in browser APIs. useRef declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node. useImperativeHandle lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used. <code_snipet> function Form() { const inputRef = useRef(null); // ... </code_snipet> Effect Hooks Effects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code. useEffect connects a component to an external system. <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(roomId); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); // ... </code_snipet> Effects are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. Don’t use Effects to orchestrate the data flow of your application. If you’re not interacting with an external system, you might not need an Effect. There are two rarely used variations of useEffect with differences in timing: useLayoutEffect fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here. useInsertionEffect fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here. Performance Hooks A common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render. To skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks: useMemo lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation. useCallback lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component. <code_snipet> function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) { const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]); // ...} </code_snipet> Sometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart). To prioritize rendering, use one of these Hooks: useTransition lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it. useDeferredValue lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first. Other Hooks These Hooks are mostly useful to library authors and aren’t commonly used in the application code. useDebugValue lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom Hook. useId lets a component associate a unique ID with itself.

Call useActionState at the top level of your component to create component state that is updated when a form action is invoked . You pass useActionState an existing form action function as well as an initial state, and it returns a new action that you use in your form, along with the latest form state and whether the Action is still pending. The latest form state is also passed to the function that you provided. <code_snipet> import { useActionState } from \"react\";async function increment(previousState, formData) { return previousState + 1;}function StatefulForm({}) { const [state, formAction] = useActionState(increment, 0); return ( <form> {state} <button formAction={formAction}>Increment</button> </form> )} </code_snipet> The form state is the value returned by the action when the form was last submitted. If the form has not yet been submitted, it is the initial state that you pass. If used with a Server Function, useActionState allows the server’s response from submitting the form to be shown even before hydration has completed. See more examples below. Parameters fn : The function to be called when the form is submitted or button pressed. When the function is called, it will receive the previous state of the form (initially the initialState that you pass, subsequently its previous return value) as its initial argument, followed by the arguments that a form action normally receives. initialState : The value you want the state to be initially. It can be any serializable value. This argument is ignored after the action is first invoked. optional permalink : A string containing the unique page URL that this form modifies.

Ensure that the same form component is rendered on the destination page (including the same action fn and permalink ) so that React knows how to pass the state through. Once the form has been hydrated, this parameter has no effect. Returns useActionState returns an array with the following values: The current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed. After the action is invoked, it will match the value returned by the action. A new action that you can pass as the action prop to your form component or formAction prop to any button component within the form. The isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition. Caveats When used with a framework that supports React Server Components, useActionState lets you make forms interactive before JavaScript has executed on the client. When used without Server Components, it is equivalent to component local state. The function passed to useActionState receives an extra argument, the previous or initial state, as its first argument. This makes its signature different than if it were used directly as a form action without using useActionState .

A new action that you pass to <form> as its action prop. A pending state that you can utilise whilst your action is processing. When the form is submitted, the action function that you provided will be called. Its return value will become the new current state of the form. The action that you provide will also receive a new first argument, namely the current state of the form. The first time the form is submitted, this will be the initial state you provided, while with subsequent submissions, it will be the return value from the last time the action was called.

Parameters fn : The function value that you want to cache. It can take any arguments and return any values. React will return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render. On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the dependencies have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it. dependencies : The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the fn code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React , it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3] . React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison algorithm. Returns On the initial render, useCallback returns the fn function you have passed. During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"an already stored fn function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render. Caveats useCallback is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it. React will not throw away the cached function unless there is a specific reason to do that. For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should match your expectations if you rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a state variable or a ref may be more appropriate. Usage Skipping re-rendering of components When you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child components. Let’s first look at the syntax for how to do this, and then see in which cases it’s useful. To cache a function between re-renders of your component, wrap its definition into the useCallback Hook: <code_snipet> import { useCallback } from 'react';function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) { const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => { post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', { referrer, orderDetails, }); }, [productId, referrer]); // ... </code_snipet> You need to pass two things to useCallback : A function definition that you want to cache between re-renders.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\": A function definition that you want to cache between re-renders. A list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your function. On the initial render, the returned function you’ll get from useCallback will be the function you passed. On the following renders, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the previous render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is ), useCallback will return the same function as before. Otherwise, useCallback will return the function you passed on this render. In other words, useCallback caches a function between re-renders until its dependencies change. Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful. Say you’re passing a handleSubmit function down from the ProductPage to the ShippingForm component: <code_snipet> function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) { // ... return ( <div className={theme}> <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} /> </div> ); </code_snipet> You’ve noticed that toggling the theme prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <ShippingForm /> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the ShippingForm component. By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, when ProductPage re-renders with a different theme , the ShippingForm component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you verified a re-render is slow, you can tell ShippingForm to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo : <code_snipet> import { memo } from 'react';const ShippingForm = memo(function ShippingForm({ onSubmit }) { // ...}); </code_snipet> With this change, ShippingForm will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is when caching a function becomes important! Let’s say you defined\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"</code_snipet> With this change, ShippingForm will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is when caching a function becomes important! Let’s say you defined handleSubmit without useCallback : <code_snipet> function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) { // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different function... function handleSubmit(orderDetails) { post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', { referrer, orderDetails, }); } return ( <div className={theme}> {/* ... so ShippingForm's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */} <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} /> </div> );} </code_snipet> In JavaScript, a function () {} or () => {} always creates a different function, similar to how the {} object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that ShippingForm props will never be the same, and your memo optimization won’t work. This is where useCallback comes in handy: <code_snipet> function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) { // Tell React to cache your function between re-renders... const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => { post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', { referrer, orderDetails, }); }, [productId, referrer]); // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change... return ( <div className={theme}> {/* ...ShippingForm will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */} <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} /> </div> );} </code_snipet> By wrapping handleSubmit in useCallback , you ensure that it’s the same function between the re-renders (until dependencies change). You don’t have to wrap a function in useCallback unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in memo , and this lets it skip re-rendering.

Note You should only rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useCallback back. Deep Dive How is useCallback related to useMemo? Show Details You will often see useMemo alongside useCallback . They are both useful when you’re trying to optimize a child component. They let you memoize (or, in other words, cache) something you’re passing down: <code_snipet> import { useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) { const product = useData('/product/' + productId); const requirements = useMemo(() => { // Calls your function and caches its result return computeRequirements(product); }, [product]); const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => { // Caches your function itself post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', { referrer, orderDetails, }); }, [productId, referrer]); return ( <div className={theme}> <ShippingForm requirements={requirements} onSubmit={handleSubmit} /> </div> );} </code_snipet> The difference is in what they’re letting you cache: useMemo caches the result of calling your function. In this example, it caches the result of calling computeRequirements(product) so that it doesn’t change unless product has changed. This lets you pass the requirements object down without unnecessarily re-rendering ShippingForm . When necessary, React will call the function you’ve passed during rendering to calculate the result. useCallback caches the function itself. Unlike useMemo , it does not call the function you provide. Instead, it caches the function you provided so that handleSubmit itself doesn’t change unless productId or referrer has changed. This lets you pass the handleSubmit function down without unnecessarily re-rendering ShippingForm . Your code won’t run until the\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='itself doesn’t change unless productId or referrer has changed. This lets you pass the handleSubmit function down without unnecessarily re-rendering ShippingForm . Your code won’t run until the user submits the form. If you’re already familiar with useMemo , you might find it helpful to think of useCallback as this: <code_snipet> // Simplified implementation (inside React)function useCallback(fn, dependencies) { return useMemo(() => fn, dependencies);} </code_snipet> Read more about the difference between useMemo and useCallback . Deep Dive Should you add useCallback everywhere? Show Details If your app is like this site, and most interactions are coarse (like replacing a page or an entire section), memoization is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful. Caching a function with useCallback is only valuable in a few cases: You pass it as a prop to a component wrapped in memo . You want to skip re-rendering if the value hasn’t changed. Memoization lets your component re-render only if dependencies changed. The function you’re passing is later used as a dependency of some Hook. For example, another function wrapped in useCallback depends on it, or you depend on this function from useEffect. There is no benefit to wrapping a function in useCallback in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that’s “always new” is enough to break memoization for an entire component. Note that useCallback does not prevent creating the function. You’re always creating a function (and that’s fine!), but React ignores it and gives you back a cached function if nothing changed. In practice, you can make a lot of memoization'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='the function. You’re always creating a function (and that’s fine!), but React ignores it and gives you back a cached function if nothing changed. In practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles: When a component visually wraps other components, let it accept JSX as children. Then, if the wrapper component updates its own state, React knows that its children don’t need to re-render. Prefer local state and don’t lift state up any further than necessary. Don’t keep transient state like forms and whether an item is hovered at the top of your tree or in a global state library. Keep your rendering logic pure. If re-rendering a component causes a problem or produces some noticeable visual artifact, it’s a bug in your component! Fix the bug instead of adding memoization. Avoid unnecessary Effects that update state. Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over. Try to remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects. For example, instead of memoization, it’s often simpler to move some object or a function inside an Effect or outside the component. If a specific interaction still feels laggy, use the React Developer Tools profiler to see which components benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it’s good to follow them in any case. In long term, we’re researching doing memoization automatically to solve this once and for all. The difference between useCallback and declaring a function directly 1 . Skipping re-rendering with useCallback and memo 2 .

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"memo In this example, the ShippingForm component is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when a React component you’re rendering is genuinely slow. Try incrementing the counter and toggling the theme. Incrementing the counter feels slow because it forces the slowed down ShippingForm to re-render. That’s expected because the counter has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen. Next, try toggling the theme. Thanks to useCallback together with memo , it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! ShippingForm skipped re-rendering because the handleSubmit function has not changed. The handleSubmit function has not changed because both productId and referrer (your useCallback dependencies) haven’t changed since last render. App.js ProductPage.js ShippingForm.js ProductPage.js Reset Fork import { useCallback } from 'react'; import ShippingForm from './ShippingForm.js'; export default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) { const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => { post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', { referrer, orderDetails, }); }, [productId, referrer]); return ( <div className={theme}> <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} /> </div> ); } function post(url, data) { // Imagine this sends a request... console.log('POST /' + url); console.log(data); } Show more Next Example Updating state from a memoized callback Sometimes, you might need to update state based on previous state from a memoized callback.

Read more about updater functions. Preventing an Effect from firing too often Sometimes, you might want to call a function from inside an Effect: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [message, setMessage] = useState(''); function createOptions() { return { serverUrl: ' roomId: roomId }; } useEffect(() => { const options = createOptions(); const connection = createConnection(options); connection.connect(); // ... </code_snipet> This creates a problem. Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect. However, if you declare createOptions as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { const options = createOptions(); const connection = createConnection(options); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [createOptions]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render // ... </code_snipet> To solve this, you can wrap the function you need to call from an Effect into useCallback : <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [message, setMessage] = useState(''); const createOptions = useCallback(() => { return { serverUrl: ' roomId: roomId }; }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes useEffect(() => { const options = createOptions(); const connection =\"),\n",

However, it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency. Move your function inside the Effect: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [message, setMessage] = useState(''); useEffect(() => { function createOptions() { // ✅ No need for useCallback or function dependencies! return { serverUrl: ' roomId: roomId }; } const options = createOptions(); const connection = createConnection(options); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes // ... </code_snipet> Now your code is simpler and doesn’t need useCallback . Learn more about removing Effect dependencies. Optimizing a custom Hook If you’re writing a custom Hook, it’s recommended to wrap any functions that it returns into useCallback : <code_snipet> function useRouter() { const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext); const navigate = useCallback((url) => { dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url }); }, [dispatch]); const goBack = useCallback(() => { dispatch({ type: 'back' }); }, [dispatch]); return { navigate, goBack, };} </code_snipet> This ensures that the consumers of your Hook can optimize their own code when needed.

You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console: <code_snipet> const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => { // .. }, [productId, referrer]); console.log([productId, referrer]); </code_snipet> You can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2 , you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same: <code_snipet> Object.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?Object.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?Object.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ... </code_snipet> When you find which dependency is breaking memoization, either find a way to remove it, or memoize it as well.

Parameters SomeContext : The context that you’ve previously created with createContext . The context itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components. Returns useContext returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the value passed to the closest SomeContext.Provider above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the defaultValue you have passed to createContext for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes. Caveats useContext() call in a component is not affected by providers returned from the same component. The corresponding <Context.Provider> needs to be above the component doing the useContext() call. React automatically re-renders all the children that use a particular context starting from the provider that receives a different value . The previous and the next values are compared with the Object.is comparison. Skipping re-renders with memo does not prevent the children receiving fresh context values. If your build system produces duplicates modules in the output (which can happen with symlinks), this can break context.

To determine the context value, React searches the component tree and finds the closest context provider above for that particular context. To pass context to a Button , wrap it or one of its parent components into the corresponding context provider: <code_snipet> function MyPage() { return ( <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\"> <Form /> </ThemeContext.Provider> );}function Form() { // ... renders buttons inside ...} </code_snipet> It doesn’t matter how many layers of components there are between the provider and the Button . When a Button anywhere inside of Form calls useContext(ThemeContext) , it will receive \"dark\" as the value. Pitfall useContext() always looks for the closest provider above the component that calls it. It searches upwards and does not consider providers in the component from which you’re calling useContext() . App.js App.js Reset Fork import { createContext, useContext } from \\'react\\'; const ThemeContext = createContext(null); export default function MyApp() { return ( <ThemeContext.Provider value=\"dark\"> <Form /> </ThemeContext.Provider> ) } function Form() { return ( <Panel title=\"Welcome\"> <Button>Sign up</Button> <Button>Log in</Button> </Panel> ); } function Panel({ title, children }) { const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); const className = \\'panel-\\' + theme; return ( <section className={className}> <h1>{title}</h1> {children} </section> ) } function Button({ children }) { const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); const className = \\'button-\\' + theme; return ( <button className={className}> {children} </button> ); } Show'),\n",

To update context, combine it with state. Declare a state variable in the parent component, and pass the current state down as the context value to the provider. <code_snipet> function MyPage() { const [theme, setTheme] = useState(\\'dark\\'); return ( <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}> <Form /> <Button onClick={() => { setTheme(\\'light\\'); }}> Switch to light theme </Button> </ThemeContext.Provider> );} </code_snipet> Now any Button inside of the provider will receive the current theme value. If you call setTheme to update the theme value that you pass to the provider, all Button components will re-render with the new \\'light\\' value. Examples of updating context 1 . Updating a value via context 2 . Updating an object via context 3 . Multiple contexts 4 . Extracting providers to a component 5 . Scaling up with context and a reducer Example 1 of 5 : Updating a value via context In this example, the MyApp component holds a state variable which is then passed to the ThemeContext provider.

Curly braces also let you pass context values that aren’t strings. Next Example Specifying a fallback default value If React can’t find any providers of that particular context in the parent tree, the context value returned by useContext() will be equal to the default value that you specified when you created that context : <code_snipet> const ThemeContext = createContext(null); </code_snipet> The default value never changes . If you want to update context, use it with state as described above. Often, instead of null , there is some more meaningful value you can use as a default, for example: <code_snipet> const ThemeContext = createContext(\\'light\\'); </code_snipet> This way, if you accidentally render some component without a corresponding provider, it won’t break. This also helps your components work well in a test environment without setting up a lot of providers in the tests. In the example below, the “Toggle theme” button is always light because it’s outside any theme context provider and the default context theme value is \\'light\\' . Try editing the default theme to be \\'dark\\' .

Whenever MyApp re-renders (for example, on a route update), this will be a different object pointing at a different function, so React will also have to re-render all components deep in the tree that call useContext(AuthContext) . In smaller apps, this is not a problem. However, there is no need to re-render them if the underlying data, like currentUser , has not changed. To help React take advantage of that fact, you may wrap the login function with useCallback and wrap the object creation into useMemo . This is a performance optimization: <code_snipet> import { useCallback, useMemo } from \\'react\\';function MyApp() { const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null); const login = useCallback((response) => { storeCredentials(response.credentials); setCurrentUser(response.user); },'),\n",

Read more about useMemo and useCallback . Troubleshooting My component doesn’t see the value from my provider There are a few common ways that this can happen: You’re rendering <SomeContext.Provider> in the same component (or below) as where you’re calling useContext() . Move <SomeContext.Provider> above and outside the component calling useContext() . You may have forgotten to wrap your component with <SomeContext.Provider> , or you might have put it in a different part of the tree than you thought. Check whether the hierarchy is right using React DevTools. You might be running into some build issue with your tooling that causes SomeContext as seen from the providing component and SomeContext as seen by the reading component to be two different objects. This can happen if you use symlinks, for example. You can verify this by assigning them to globals like window.SomeContext1 and window.SomeContext2 and then checking whether window.SomeContext1 === window.SomeContext2 in the console. If they’re not the same, fix that issue on the build tool level. I am always getting undefined from my context although the default value is different You might have a provider without a value in the tree: <code_snipet> // 🚩 Doesn't work: no value prop<ThemeContext.Provider> <Button /></ThemeContext.Provider> </code_snipet> If you forget to specify value , it’s like passing value={undefined} .

Parameters value : The value you want to defer. It can have any type. optional initialValue : A value to use during the initial render of a component. If this option is omitted, useDeferredValue will not defer during the initial render, because there’s no previous version of value that it can render instead. Returns currentValue : During the initial render, the returned deferred value will be the initialValue , or the same as the value you provided. During updates, React will first attempt a re-render with the old value (so it will return the old value), and then try another re-render in the background with the new value (so it will return the updated value). Caveats When an update is inside a Transition, useDeferredValue always returns the new value and does not spawn a deferred render, since the update is already deferred. The values you pass to useDeferredValue should either be primitive values (like strings and numbers) or objects created outside of rendering. If you create a new object during rendering and immediately pass it to useDeferredValue , it will be different on every render, causing unnecessary background re-renders. When useDeferredValue receives a different value (compared with Object.is ), in addition to the current render (when it still uses the previous value), it schedules a re-render in the background with the new value. The background re-render is interruptible: if there’s another update to the value , React will restart the background re-render from scratch.

If the background update caused by a new value suspends the UI, the user will not see the fallback. They will see the old deferred value until the data loads. useDeferredValue does not by itself prevent extra network requests. There is no fixed delay caused by useDeferredValue itself. As soon as React finishes the original re-render, React will immediately start working on the background re-render with the new deferred value. Any updates caused by events (like typing) will interrupt the background re-render and get prioritized over it. The background re-render caused by useDeferredValue does not fire Effects until it’s committed to the screen. If the background re-render suspends, its Effects will run after the data loads and the UI updates. Usage Showing stale content while fresh content is loading Call useDeferredValue at the top level of your component to defer updating some part of your UI. <code_snipet> import { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';function SearchPage() { const [query, setQuery] = useState(''); const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query); // ...} </code_snipet> During the initial render, the deferred value will be the same as the value you provided. During updates, the deferred value will “lag behind” the latest value . In particular, React will first re-render without updating the deferred value, and then try to re-render with the newly received value in the background. Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.

The results for \"a\" get replaced by the loading fallback. App.js SearchResults.js App.js Reset Fork import { Suspense, useState } from \\'react\\'; import SearchResults from \\'./SearchResults.js\\'; export default function App() { const [query, setQuery] = useState(\\'\\'); return ( <> <label> Search albums: <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} /> </label> <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}> <SearchResults query={query} /> </Suspense> </> ); } Show more A common alternative UI pattern is to defer updating the list of results and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. Call useDeferredValue to pass a deferred version of the query down: <code_snipet> export default function App() { const [query, setQuery] = useState(\\'\\'); const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query); return ( <> <label> Search albums: <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} /> </label> <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}> <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} /> </Suspense> </> );} </code_snipet> The query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit. Enter \"a\" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to \"ab\" . Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the stale result list until the new results have loaded: App.js SearchResults.js App.js Reset Fork import { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from \\'react\\'; import SearchResults from \\'./SearchResults.js\\'; export default'),\n",

Show Details You can think of it as happening in two steps: First, React re-renders with the new query ( \"ab\" ) but with the old deferredQuery (still \"a\") . The deferredQuery value, which you pass to the result list, is deferred: it “lags behind” the query value. In the background, React tries to re-render with both query and deferredQuery updated to \"ab\" . If this re-render completes, React will show it on the screen. However, if it suspends (the results for \"ab\" have not loaded yet), React will abandon this rendering attempt, and retry this re-render again after the data has loaded. The user will keep seeing the stale deferred value until the data is ready. The deferred “background” rendering is interruptible. For example, if you type into the input again, React will abandon it and restart with the new value. React will always use the latest provided value. Note that there is still a network request per each keystroke. What’s being deferred here is displaying results (until they’re ready), not the network requests themselves. Even if the user continues typing, responses for each keystroke get cached, so pressing Backspace is instant and doesn’t fetch again. Indicating that the content is stale In the example above, there is no indication that the result list for the latest query is still loading. This can be confusing to the user if the new results take a while to load. To make it more obvious'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"example above, there is no indication that the result list for the latest query is still loading. This can be confusing to the user if the new results take a while to load. To make it more obvious to the user that the result list does not match the latest query, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed: <code_snipet> <div style={{ opacity: query !== deferredQuery ? 0.5 : 1,}}> <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} /></div> </code_snipet> With this change, as soon as you start typing, the stale result list gets slightly dimmed until the new result list loads. You can also add a CSS transition to delay dimming so that it feels gradual, like in the example below: App.js SearchResults.js App.js Reset Fork import { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react'; import SearchResults from './SearchResults.js'; export default function App() { const [query, setQuery] = useState(''); const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query); const isStale = query !== deferredQuery; return ( <> <label> Search albums: <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} /> </label> <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}> <div style={{ opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1, transition: isStale ? 'opacity 0.2s 0.2s linear' : 'opacity 0s 0s linear' }}> <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} /> </div> </Suspense> </> ); } Show more Deferring re-rendering for a part of the UI You can also apply useDeferredValue as a performance optimization. It is useful when a part of your UI is slow to re-render, there’s no easy way to optimize it, and you want to prevent it from blocking the rest of the UI. Imagine you have a text field and a component (like a chart or a long list) that re-renders on every keystroke: <code_snipet> function App() { const [text, setText] = useState(''); return ( <> <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> <SlowList text={text} /> </> );} </code_snipet> First, optimize SlowList to skip re-rendering when its props are the\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"return ( <> <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> <SlowList text={text} /> </> );} </code_snipet> First, optimize SlowList to skip re-rendering when its props are the same. To do this, wrap it in memo : <code_snipet> const SlowList = memo(function SlowList({ text }) { // ...}); </code_snipet> However, this only helps if the SlowList props are the same as during the previous render. The problem you’re facing now is that it’s slow when they’re different, and when you actually need to show different visual output. Concretely, the main performance problem is that whenever you type into the input, the SlowList receives new props, and re-rendering its entire tree makes the typing feel janky. In this case, useDeferredValue lets you prioritize updating the input (which must be fast) over updating the result list (which is allowed to be slower): <code_snipet> function App() { const [text, setText] = useState(''); const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text); return ( <> <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> <SlowList text={deferredText} /> </> );} </code_snipet> This does not make re-rendering of the SlowList faster. However, it tells React that re-rendering the list can be deprioritized so that it doesn’t block the keystrokes. The list will “lag behind” the input and then “catch up”. Like before, React will attempt to update the list as soon as possible, but will not block the user from typing. The difference between useDeferredValue and unoptimized re-rendering 1 . Deferred re-rendering of the list 2 . Unoptimized re-rendering of the list Example 1 of 2 : Deferred re-rendering of the list In this example, each item in the SlowList component is artificially slowed down so that you can see how useDeferredValue lets you keep the input responsive. Type into the input and notice that typing feels snappy while the list “lags behind” it. App.js SlowList.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\"),\n",

This is because whenever the text changes, React needs to be able to re-render the parent component quickly. During that re-render, deferredText still has its previous value, so SlowList is able to skip re-rendering (its props have not changed). Without memo , it would have to re-render anyway, defeating the point of the optimization. Deep Dive How is deferring a value different from debouncing and throttling? Show Details There are two common optimization techniques you might have used before in this scenario: Debouncing means you’d wait for the user to stop typing (e.g. for a second) before updating the list. Throttling means you’d update the list every once in a while (e.g. at most once a second). While these techniques are helpful in some cases, useDeferredValue is better suited to optimizing rendering because it is deeply integrated with React itself and adapts to the user’s device. Unlike debouncing or throttling, it doesn’t require choosing any fixed delay. If the user’s device is fast (e.g. powerful laptop), the deferred re-render would happen almost immediately and wouldn’t be noticeable. If the user’s device is slow, the list would “lag behind” the input proportionally to how slow the device is. Also, unlike with debouncing or throttling, deferred re-renders done by useDeferredValue are interruptible by default. This means that if React is in the middle of re-rendering a large list, but the user makes another\"),\n",

This means that if React is in the middle of re-rendering a large list, but the user makes another keystroke, React will abandon that re-render, handle the keystroke, and then start rendering in the background again. By contrast, debouncing and throttling still produce a janky experience because they’re blocking: they merely postpone the moment when rendering blocks the keystroke. If the work you’re optimizing doesn’t happen during rendering, debouncing and throttling are still useful. For example, they can let you fire fewer network requests.

See the difference between passing an array of dependencies, an empty array, and no dependencies at all. Returns useEffect returns undefined . Caveats useEffect is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it. If you’re not trying to synchronize with some external system, you probably don’t need an Effect. When Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function. If some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed. To fix this, remove unnecessary object and function dependencies. You can also extract state updates and non-reactive logic outside of your Effect. If your Effect wasn’t caused by an interaction (like a click), React will generally let the browser paint the updated screen first before running your Effect. If your Effect is doing something visual (for example, positioning a tooltip), and the delay is noticeable (for example, it flickers), replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect .

However, if you must defer the work until after paint, such as an alert() , you can use setTimeout . See reactwg/react-18/128 for more information. Even if your Effect was caused by an interaction (like a click), React may allow the browser to repaint the screen before processing the state updates inside your Effect. Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must block the browser from repainting the screen, you need to replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect . Effects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering. Usage Connecting to an external system Some components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren’t controlled by React, so they are called external. To connect your component to some external system, call useEffect at the top level of your component: <code_snipet> import { useEffect } from 'react';import { createConnection } from './chat.js';function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState(' useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ...} </code_snipet> You need to pass two arguments to useEffect : A setup function with setup code that connects to that system. It should return a cleanup function with cleanup code that disconnects from that system. A list of dependencies including every value from your component used inside of those functions. React calls your setup and cleanup functions whenever it’s necessary, which may happen multiple times: Your setup code runs when your component is added to the page (mounts) . After every re-render of your component where the dependencies have changed: First, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='code runs when your component is added to the page (mounts) . After every re-render of your component where the dependencies have changed: First, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state. Then, your setup code runs with the new props and state. Your cleanup code runs one final time after your component is removed from the page (unmounts). Let’s illustrate this sequence for the example above. When the ChatRoom component above gets added to the page, it will connect to the chat room with the initial serverUrl and roomId . If either serverUrl or roomId change as a result of a re-render (say, if the user picks a different chat room in a dropdown), your Effect will disconnect from the previous room, and connect to the next one. When the ChatRoom component is removed from the page, your Effect will disconnect one last time. To help you find bugs, in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the setup . This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development). See common solutions. Try to write every Effect as an independent process and think about a single setup/cleanup cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether your component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. When your cleanup logic correctly “mirrors” the setup logic, your Effect is resilient to running setup and cleanup as often as needed.

If you find yourself often needing to manually write Effects, it’s usually a sign that you need to extract some custom Hooks for common behaviors your components rely on. For example, this useChatRoom custom Hook “hides” the logic of your Effect behind a more declarative API: <code_snipet> function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) { useEffect(() => { const options = { serverUrl: serverUrl, roomId: roomId }; const connection = createConnection(options); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId, serverUrl]);} </code_snipet> Then you can use it from any component like this: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState(\\' useChatRoom({ roomId: roomId, serverUrl: serverUrl }); // ... </code_snipet> There are also many excellent custom Hooks for every purpose available in the React ecosystem.

For example, if you have a third-party map widget or a video player component written without React, you can use an Effect to call methods on it that make its state match the current state of your React component. This Effect creates an instance of a MapWidget class defined in map-widget.js . When you change the zoomLevel prop of the Map component, the Effect calls the setZoom() on the class instance to keep it synchronized: App.js Map.js map-widget.js Map.js Reset Fork import { useRef, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; import { MapWidget } from \\'./map-widget.js\\'; export default function Map({ zoomLevel }) { const containerRef = useRef(null); const mapRef = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { if (mapRef.current === null) { mapRef.current = new MapWidget(containerRef.current); } const map = mapRef.current; map.setZoom(zoomLevel); }, [zoomLevel]); return ( <div style={{'),\n",

After the Map React component is removed from the tree, both the DOM node and the MapWidget class instance will be automatically garbage-collected by the browser JavaScript engine. Fetching data with Effects You can use an Effect to fetch data for your component. Note that if you use a framework, using your framework’s data fetching mechanism will be a lot more efficient than writing Effects manually. If you want to fetch data from an Effect manually, your code might look like this: <code_snipet> import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';import { fetchBio } from './api.js';export default function Page() { const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice'); const [bio, setBio] = useState(null); useEffect(() => { let ignore = false; setBio(null); fetchBio(person).then(result => { if (!ignore) { setBio(result); } }); return () => { ignore = true; }; }, [person]); // ... </code_snipet> Note the ignore variable which is initialized to false , and is set to true during cleanup. This ensures your code doesn’t suffer from “race conditions”: network responses may arrive in a different order than you sent them.

It’s easier to use a custom Hook—either your own or maintained by the community. Deep Dive What are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects? Show Details Writing fetch calls inside Effects is a popular way to fetch data , especially in fully client-side apps. This is, however, a very manual approach and it has significant downsides: Effects don’t run on the server. This means that the initial server-rendered HTML will only include a loading state with no data. The client computer will have to download all JavaScript and render your app only to discover that now it needs to load the data. This is not very efficient. Fetching directly in Effects makes it easy to create “network'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='will have to download all JavaScript and render your app only to discover that now it needs to load the data. This is not very efficient. Fetching directly in Effects makes it easy to create “network waterfalls”. You render the parent component, it fetches some data, renders the child components, and then they start fetching their data. If the network is not very fast, this is significantly slower than fetching all data in parallel. Fetching directly in Effects usually means you don’t preload or cache data. For example, if the component unmounts and then mounts again, it would have to fetch the data again. It’s not very ergonomic. There’s quite a bit of boilerplate code involved when writing fetch calls in a way that doesn’t suffer from bugs like race conditions. This list of downsides is not specific to React. It applies to fetching data on mount with any library. Like with routing, data fetching is not trivial to do well, so we recommend the following approaches: If you use a framework , use its built-in data fetching mechanism. Modern React frameworks have integrated data fetching mechanisms that are efficient and don’t suffer from the above pitfalls. Otherwise, consider using or building a client-side cache. Popular open source solutions include React Query , useSWR , and React Router 6.4+. You can build your own solution too, in which case you would use Effects under the hood but also add logic for deduplicating requests, caching responses, and avoiding network waterfalls (by preloading data or hoisting data requirements to routes). You can continue fetching data directly in Effects if neither of these approaches suit you. Specifying reactive dependencies Notice that you can’t “choose” the dependencies of your Effect. Every reactive value used by your Effect’s code must be declared as a dependency. Your Effect’s dependency list is determined by the surrounding code: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value const [serverUrl,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"code must be declared as a dependency. Your Effect’s dependency list is determined by the surrounding code: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState(' // This is a reactive value too useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads these reactive values connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ✅ So you must specify them as dependencies of your Effect // ...} </code_snipet> If either serverUrl or roomId change, your Effect will reconnect to the chat using the new values. Reactive values include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component. Since roomId and serverUrl are reactive values, you can’t remove them from the dependencies. If you try to omit them and your linter is correctly configured for React, the linter will flag this as a mistake you need to fix: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState(' useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'roomId' and 'serverUrl' // ...} </code_snipet> To remove a dependency, you need to “prove” to the linter that it doesn’t need to be a dependency. For example, you can move serverUrl out of your component to prove that it’s not reactive and won’t change on re-renders: <code_snipet> const serverUrl = ' // Not a reactive value anymorefunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared // ...} </code_snipet> Now that serverUrl is not a reactive value (and can’t change on a re-render), it doesn’t need to be a dependency.

Pitfall If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { // ... // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this: // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps}, []); </code_snipet> When dependencies don’t match the code, there is a high risk of introducing bugs.

As a result of this fix, it won’t need to cleanup and setup the interval again every time the count changes. Removing unnecessary object dependencies If your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the options object is different for every render: <code_snipet> const serverUrl = ' ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [message, setMessage] = useState(''); const options = { // 🚩 This object is created from scratch on every re-render serverUrl: serverUrl, roomId: roomId }; useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(options); // It's used inside the Effect connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [options]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a re-render // ... </code_snipet> Avoid using an object created during rendering as a dependency.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='value. Read more about removing dependencies. Reading the latest props and state from an Effect Under Construction This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React. By default, when you read a reactive value from an Effect, you have to add it as a dependency. This ensures that your Effect “reacts” to every change of that value. For most dependencies, that’s the behavior you want. However, sometimes you’ll want to read the latest props and state from an Effect without “reacting” to them. For example, imagine you want to log the number of the items in the shopping cart for every page visit: <code_snipet> function Page({ url, shoppingCart }) { useEffect(() => { logVisit(url, shoppingCart.length); }, [url, shoppingCart]); // ✅ All dependencies declared // ...} </code_snipet> What if you want to log a new page visit after every url change, but not if only the shoppingCart changes? You can’t exclude shoppingCart from dependencies without breaking the reactivity rules. However, you can express that you don’t want a piece of code to “react” to changes even though it is called from inside an Effect. Declare an Effect Event with the useEffectEvent Hook, and move the code reading shoppingCart inside of it: <code_snipet> function Page({ url, shoppingCart }) { const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => { logVisit(visitedUrl, shoppingCart.length) }); useEffect(() => { onVisit(url); }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared // ...} </code_snipet> Effect Events are not reactive and must always be omitted from dependencies of your Effect. This is what lets you put non-reactive code (where you can read the latest value of some props and state) inside of them. By reading shoppingCart inside of onVisit , you ensure that shoppingCart won’t re-run your Effect. Read more about how Effect Events let you separate reactive and non-reactive code.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='re-run your Effect. Read more about how Effect Events let you separate reactive and non-reactive code. Displaying different content on the server and the client If your app uses server rendering (either directly or via a framework ), your component will render in two different environments. On the server, it will render to produce the initial HTML. On the client, React will run the rendering code again so that it can attach your event handlers to that HTML. This is why, for hydration to work, your initial render output must be identical on the client and the server. In rare cases, you might need to display different content on the client. For example, if your app reads some data from localStorage , it can’t possibly do that on the server. Here is how you could implement this: <code_snipet> function MyComponent() { const [didMount, setDidMount] = useState(false); useEffect(() => { setDidMount(true); }, []); if (didMount) { // ... return client-only JSX ... } else { // ... return initial JSX ... }} </code_snipet> While the app is loading, the user will see the initial render output. Then, when it’s loaded and hydrated, your Effect will run and set didMount to true , triggering a re-render. This will switch to the client-only render output. Effects don’t run on the server, so this is why didMount was false during the initial server render. Use this pattern sparingly. Keep in mind that users with a slow connection will see the initial content for quite a bit of time—potentially, many seconds—so you don’t want to make jarring changes to your component’s appearance. In many cases, you can avoid the need for this by conditionally showing different things with CSS.

Read more about how this helps find bugs and how to fix your logic.

Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2 , you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same: <code_snipet> Object.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?Object.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?Object.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ... </code_snipet> When you find the dependency that is different on every re-render, you can usually fix it in one of these ways: Updating state based on previous state from an Effect Removing unnecessary object dependencies Removing unnecessary function dependencies Reading the latest props and state from an'),\n",

My Effect keeps re-running in an infinite cycle If your Effect runs in an infinite cycle, these two things must be true: Your Effect is updating some state. That state leads to a re-render, which causes the Effect’s dependencies to change. Before you start fixing the problem, ask yourself whether your Effect is connecting to some external system (like DOM, network, a third-party widget, and so on). Why does your Effect need to set state? Does it synchronize with that external system? Or are you trying to manage your application’s data flow with it? If there is no external system, consider whether removing the Effect altogether would simplify your logic. If you’re genuinely synchronizing with some external system, think about why and under what conditions your Effect should update the state. Has something changed that affects your component’s visual output? If you need to keep track of some data that isn’t used by rendering, a ref (which doesn’t trigger re-renders) might be more appropriate. Verify your Effect doesn’t update the state (and trigger re-renders) more than needed. Finally, if your Effect is updating the state at the right time, but there is still a loop, it’s because that state update leads to one of the Effect’s dependencies changing.

If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it. useId should not be used to generate keys in a list. Keys should be generated from your data. Usage Pitfall Do not call useId to generate keys in a list. Keys should be generated from your data. Generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes Call useId at the top level of your component to generate a unique ID: <code_snipet> import { useId } from \\'react\\';function PasswordField() { const passwordHintId = useId(); // ... </code_snipet> You can then pass the generated ID to different attributes: <code_snipet> <> <input type=\"password\" aria-describedby={passwordHintId} /> <p id={passwordHintId}></> </code_snipet> Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful. HTML accessibility attributes like aria-describedby let you specify that two tags are related to each other. For example, you can specify that an element (like an input) is described by another element (like a paragraph). In regular HTML, you would write it like this: <code_snipet> <label> Password: <input type=\"password\" aria-describedby=\"password-hint\" /></label><p id=\"password-hint\"> The password should contain at least 18 characters</p> </code_snipet> However, hardcoding IDs like this is not a good practice in React. A component may be rendered more than once on the page—but IDs have to be unique! Instead of hardcoding an ID, generate a unique ID with useId : <code_snipet> import { useId } from \\'react\\';function PasswordField() { const'),\n",

Pitfall With server rendering , useId requires an identical component tree on the server and the client . If the trees you render on the server and the client don’t match exactly, the generated IDs won’t match. Deep Dive Why is useId better than an incrementing counter? Show Details You might be wondering why useId is better than incrementing a global variable like nextId++ . The primary benefit of useId is that React ensures that it works with server rendering. During server rendering, your components generate HTML output. Later, on the client, hydration attaches your event handlers to the generated HTML. For hydration to work, the client output must match the server HTML. This is very difficult to guarantee with an incrementing counter because the order in which the Client Components are hydrated may not match the order in which the server HTML was emitted. By calling useId , you ensure that hydration will work, and the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='counter because the order in which the Client Components are hydrated may not match the order in which the server HTML was emitted. By calling useId , you ensure that hydration will work, and the output will match between the server and the client. Inside React, useId is generated from the “parent path” of the calling component. This is why, if the client and the server tree are the same, the “parent path” will match up regardless of rendering order. Generating IDs for several related elements If you need to give IDs to multiple related elements, you can call useId to generate a shared prefix for them: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useId } from \\'react\\'; export default function Form() { const id = useId(); return ( <form> <label htmlFor={id + \\'-firstName\\'}>First Name:</label> <input id={id + \\'-firstName\\'} type=\"text\" /> <hr /> <label htmlFor={id + \\'-lastName\\'}>Last Name:</label> <input id={id + \\'-lastName\\'} type=\"text\" /> </form> ); } This lets you avoid calling useId for every single element that needs a unique ID. Specifying a shared prefix for all generated IDs If you render multiple independent React applications on a single page, pass identifierPrefix as an option to your createRoot or hydrateRoot calls. This ensures that the IDs generated by the two different apps never clash because every identifier generated with useId will start with the distinct prefix you’ve specified. index.js index.html App.js index.js Reset Fork import { createRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\'; import App from \\'./App.js\\'; import \\'./styles.css\\'; const root1 = createRoot(document.getElementById(\\'root1\\'), { identifierPrefix: \\'my-first-app-\\' }); root1.render(<App />); const root2 = createRoot(document.getElementById(\\'root2\\'), { identifierPrefix: \\'my-second-app-\\' }); root2.render(<App />); Using the same ID prefix on the client and the server If you render multiple independent React apps on the same page , and some of these apps are server-rendered, make sure that the identifierPrefix you'),\n",

Parameters ref : The ref you received as a prop to the MyInput component. createHandle : A function that takes no arguments and returns the ref handle you want to expose. That ref handle can have any type. Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose. optional dependencies : The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the createHandle code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React , it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3] . React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If a re-render resulted in a change to some dependency, or if you omitted this argument, your createHandle function will re-execute, and the newly created handle will be assigned to the ref.

For example, suppose you don’t want to expose the entire <input> DOM node, but you want to expose two of its methods: focus and scrollIntoView . To do this, keep the real browser DOM in a separate ref. Then use useImperativeHandle to expose a handle with only the methods that you want the parent component to call: <code_snipet> import { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from \\'react\\';function MyInput({ ref }) { const inputRef = useRef(null); useImperativeHandle(ref, () => { return { focus() { inputRef.current.focus(); }, scrollIntoView() { inputRef.current.scrollIntoView(); }, }; }, []); return <input ref={inputRef} />;}; </code_snipet> Now, if the parent component gets a ref to MyInput , it will be able to call the focus and scrollIntoView methods on it.

Parameters setup : The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. When your component is added to the DOM, but before any layout Effects fire, React will run your setup function.

This results in an “interleaving” of the cleanup and setup functions. Usage Injecting dynamic styles from CSS-in-JS libraries Traditionally, you would style React components using plain CSS. <code_snipet> // In your JS file:<button className=\"success\" />// In your CSS file:.success { color: green; } </code_snipet> Some teams prefer to author styles directly in JavaScript code instead of writing CSS files. This usually requires using a CSS-in-JS library or a tool. There are three common approaches to CSS-in-JS: Static extraction to CSS files with a compiler Inline styles, e.g. <div style={{ opacity: 1 }}> Runtime injection of <style> tags If you use CSS-in-JS, we recommend a combination of the first two approaches (CSS files for static styles, inline styles for dynamic styles). We don’t recommend runtime <style> tag injection for two reasons: Runtime injection forces the browser to recalculate the styles a lot more often. Runtime injection can be very slow if it happens at the wrong time in the React lifecycle. The first problem is not solvable, but useInsertionEffect helps you solve the second problem. Call useInsertionEffect to insert the styles before any layout Effects fire: <code_snipet> // Inside your CSS-in-JS librarylet isInserted = new Set();function useCSS(rule) { useInsertionEffect(() => { // As explained earlier, we don\\'t recommend runtime injection of <style> tags. // But if you have to do it, then it\\'s important to do in useInsertionEffect. if (!isInserted.has(rule)) { isInserted.add(rule); document.head.appendChild(getStyleForRule(rule)); } }); return rule;}function Button() {'),\n",

If you need to collect which CSS rules have been used on the server, you can do it during rendering: <code_snipet> let collectedRulesSet = new Set();function useCSS(rule) { if (typeof window === 'undefined') { collectedRulesSet.add(rule); } useInsertionEffect(() => { // ... }); return rule;} </code_snipet> Read more about upgrading CSS-in-JS libraries with runtime injection to useInsertionEffect . Deep Dive How is this better than injecting styles during rendering or useLayoutEffect? Show Details If you insert styles during rendering and React is processing a non-blocking update, the browser will recalculate the styles every single frame while rendering a component tree, which can be extremely slow. useInsertionEffect is better than inserting styles during useLayoutEffect or useEffect because it ensures that by the time other Effects run in your components, the <style> tags have already been inserted.

When Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function. If some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed. To fix this, remove unnecessary object and function dependencies. You can also extract state updates and non-reactive logic outside of your Effect. Effects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering. The code inside useLayoutEffect and all state updates scheduled from it block the browser from repainting the screen. When used excessively, this makes your app slow. When possible, prefer useEffect . If you trigger a state update inside useLayoutEffect , React will execute all remaining Effects immediately including useEffect . Usage Measuring layout before the browser repaints the screen Most components don’t need to know their position and size on the screen to decide what to render. They only return some JSX. Then the browser calculates their layout (position and size) and repaints the screen. Sometimes, that’s not enough. Imagine a tooltip that appears next to some element on hover. If there’s enough space, the tooltip should appear above the element, but if it doesn’t fit, it should appear below. In order to render the tooltip at the right final position, you need to know its height (i.e. whether it fits at the top). To do this, you need to render in two passes: Render the tooltip anywhere (even with a wrong position). Measure its height and decide where to place the tooltip. Render the tooltip again in the correct place. All of this needs to happen before the browser repaints the screen. You'),\n",

React places it in the DOM and runs the code in useLayoutEffect . Your useLayoutEffect measures the height of the tooltip content and triggers an immediate re-render. Tooltip renders again with the real tooltipHeight (so the tooltip is correctly positioned). React updates it in the DOM, and the browser finally displays the tooltip. Hover over the buttons below and see how the tooltip adjusts its position depending on whether it fits: App.js ButtonWithTooltip.js Tooltip.js TooltipContainer.js Tooltip.js Reset Fork import { useRef, useLayoutEffect, useState } from 'react'; import { createPortal } from 'react-dom'; import TooltipContainer from './TooltipContainer.js'; export default function Tooltip({ children, targetRect }) { const ref = useRef(null); const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0); useLayoutEffect(() => { const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect(); setTooltipHeight(height); console.log('Measured tooltip height: ' + height); }, []); let tooltipX = 0; let tooltipY = 0; if (targetRect !== null) { tooltipX = targetRect.left; tooltipY = targetRect.top - tooltipHeight; if (tooltipY < 0) { // It\"),\n",

Try to avoid this when you can. Troubleshooting I’m getting an error: “ useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server” The purpose of useLayoutEffect is to let your component use layout information for rendering: Render the initial content. Measure the layout before the browser repaints the screen. Render the final content using the layout information you’ve read. When you or your framework uses server rendering , your React app renders to HTML on the server for the initial render. This lets you show the initial HTML before the JavaScript code loads. The problem is that on the server, there is no layout information. In the earlier example , the useLayoutEffect call in the Tooltip component lets it position itself correctly (either above or below content) depending on the content height. If you tried to render Tooltip as a part of the initial server HTML, this would be impossible to determine. On the server, there is no layout yet! So, even if you rendered it on the server, its position would “jump” on the client after the JavaScript loads and runs. Usually, components that rely on layout information don’t need to render on the server anyway. For example, it probably doesn’t make sense to show a Tooltip during the initial render. It is triggered by a client interaction. However, if you’re running into this problem, you have a few different options: Replace useLayoutEffect with useEffect . This tells React that it’s okay to display the initial render result without blocking the paint (because the original HTML will become visible before your Effect runs).\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='with useEffect . This tells React that it’s okay to display the initial render result without blocking the paint (because the original HTML will become visible before your Effect runs). Alternatively, mark your component as client-only. This tells React to replace its content up to the closest <Suspense> boundary with a loading fallback (for example, a spinner or a glimmer) during server rendering. Alternatively, you can render a component with useLayoutEffect only after hydration. Keep a boolean isMounted state that’s initialized to false , and set it to true inside a useEffect call. Your rendering logic can then be like return isMounted ? <RealContent /> : <FallbackContent /> . On the server and during the hydration, the user will see FallbackContent which should not call useLayoutEffect . Then React will replace it with RealContent which runs on the client only and can include useLayoutEffect calls. If you synchronize your component with an external data store and rely on useLayoutEffect for different reasons than measuring layout, consider useSyncExternalStore instead which supports server rendering.

Parameters calculateValue : The function calculating the value that you want to cache. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your function during the initial render. On next renders, React will return the same value again if the dependencies have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will call calculateValue , return its result, and store it so it can be reused later. dependencies : The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the calculateValue code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React , it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3] . React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. Returns On the initial render, useMemo returns the result of calling calculateValue with no arguments.

Caveats useMemo is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it. In Strict Mode, React will call your calculation function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your calculation function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls will be ignored. React will not throw away the cached value unless there is a specific reason to do that. For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should be fine if you rely on useMemo solely as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a state variable or a ref may be more appropriate. Note Caching return values like this is also known as memoization , which is why this Hook is called useMemo . Usage Skipping expensive recalculations To cache a calculation between re-renders, wrap it in a useMemo call at the top level of your component: <code_snipet> import { useMemo } from 'react';function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) { const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]); // ...} </code_snipet> You need to pass two things to useMemo : A calculation function that takes no arguments, like () => , and returns what you wanted to calculate.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='You need to pass two things to useMemo : A calculation function that takes no arguments, like () => , and returns what you wanted to calculate. A list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your calculation. On the initial render, the value you’ll get from useMemo will be the result of calling your calculation . On every subsequent render, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the last render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is ), useMemo will return the value you already calculated before. Otherwise, React will re-run your calculation and return the new value. In other words, useMemo caches a calculation result between re-renders until its dependencies change. Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful. By default, React will re-run the entire body of your component every time that it re-renders. For example, if this TodoList updates its state or receives new props from its parent, the filterTodos function will re-run: <code_snipet> function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) { const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab); // ...} </code_snipet> Usually, this isn’t a problem because most calculations are very fast. However, if you’re filtering or transforming a large array, or doing some expensive computation, you might want to skip doing it again if data hasn’t changed. If both todos and tab are the same as they were during the last render, wrapping the calculation in useMemo like earlier lets you reuse visibleTodos you’ve already calculated before. This type of caching is called memoization. Note You should only rely on useMemo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useMemo to improve performance. Deep Dive How to tell if a calculation is expensive?

Show Details In general, unless you’re creating or looping over thousands of objects, it’s probably not expensive. If you want to get more confidence, you can add a console log to measure the time spent in a piece of code: <code_snipet> console.time('filter array');const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);console.timeEnd('filter array'); </code_snipet> Perform the interaction you’re measuring (for example, typing into the input). You will then see logs like filter array: 0.15ms in your console. If the overall logged time adds up to a significant amount (say, 1ms or more), it might make sense to memoize that calculation. As an experiment, you can then wrap the calculation in useMemo to verify whether the total logged time has decreased for that interaction or not: <code_snipet> console.time('filter array');const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => { return filterTodos(todos, tab); // Skipped if todos and tab haven't changed}, [todos, tab]);console.timeEnd('filter array'); </code_snipet> useMemo won’t make the first render faster. It only helps you skip unnecessary work on updates. Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users’ so it’s a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown. For example, Chrome offers a CPU Throttling option for this. Also note that measuring performance in development will not give you the most accurate results. (For example, when Strict Mode is on, you will see each component render twice rather than once.) To get the most accurate timings, build your app for production and test it on a device like your users have. Deep Dive Should you add useMemo everywhere?

On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful. Optimizing with useMemo is only valuable in a few cases: The calculation you’re putting in useMemo is noticeably slow, and its dependencies rarely change. You pass it as a prop to a component wrapped in memo . You want to skip re-rendering if the value hasn’t changed. Memoization lets your component re-render only when dependencies aren’t the same. The value you’re passing is later used as a dependency of some Hook. For example, maybe another useMemo calculation value depends on it. Or maybe you are depending on this value from useEffect. There is no benefit to wrapping a calculation in useMemo in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside of this approach is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that’s “always new” is enough to break memoization for an entire component. In practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles: When a component visually wraps other components, let it accept JSX as children. This way, when the wrapper component updates its own state, React knows that its children don’t need to re-render. Prefer local state and don’t lift state up any further than necessary. For example, don’t keep transient state like forms and whether an item is hovered at the top of your tree or in a global state library. Keep your rendering logic pure.

Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over. Try to remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects. For example, instead of memoization, it’s often simpler to move some object or a function inside an Effect or outside the component. If a specific interaction still feels laggy, use the React Developer Tools profiler to see which components would benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it’s good to follow them in any case. In the long term, we’re researching doing granular memoization automatically to solve this once and for all. The difference between useMemo and calculating a value directly 1 . Skipping recalculation with useMemo 2 . Always recalculating a value Example 1 of 2 : Skipping recalculation with useMemo In this example, the filterTodos implementation is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when some JavaScript function you’re calling during rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme. Switching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down filterTodos to re-execute. That’s expected because the tab has changed, and so the entire calculation needs to re-run. (If you’re curious why it runs twice, it’s explained here. ) Toggle the theme. Thanks to useMemo , it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! The slow filterTodos call was skipped because both todos and tab (which you pass as dependencies to useMemo ) haven’t changed since the last render.

To illustrate this, let’s say this TodoList component passes the visibleTodos as a prop to the child List component: <code_snipet> export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) { // ... return ( <div className={theme}> <List items={visibleTodos} /> </div> );} </code_snipet> You’ve noticed that toggling the theme prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <List /> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the List component. By default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, when TodoList re-renders with a different theme , the List component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you’ve verified that a re-render is slow, you can tell List to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo : <code_snipet> import { memo } from 'react';const List = memo(function List({ items }) { // ...}); </code_snipet> With this change, List will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is where caching the calculation becomes important! Imagine that you calculated visibleTodos without useMemo : <code_snipet> export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) { // Every time the theme changes, this\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"calculation becomes important! Imagine that you calculated visibleTodos without useMemo : <code_snipet> export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) { // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different array... const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab); return ( <div className={theme}> {/* ... so List's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */} <List items={visibleTodos} /> </div> );} </code_snipet> In the above example, the filterTodos function always creates a different array, similar to how the {} object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that List props will never be the same, and your memo optimization won’t work. This is where useMemo comes in handy: <code_snipet> export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) { // Tell React to cache your calculation between re-renders... const visibleTodos = useMemo( () => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab] // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change... ); return ( <div className={theme}> {/* ...List will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */} <List items={visibleTodos} /> </div> );} </code_snipet> By wrapping the visibleTodos calculation in useMemo , you ensure that it has the same value between the re-renders (until dependencies change). You don’t have to wrap a calculation in useMemo unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in memo , and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are a few other reasons to add useMemo which are described further on this page. Deep Dive Memoizing individual JSX nodes Show Details Instead of wrapping List in memo , you could wrap the <List /> JSX node itself in useMemo : <code_snipet> export default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) { const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]); const children = useMemo(() => <List items={visibleTodos} />, [visibleTodos]);\"),\n",

If the visibleTodos haven’t changed, List won’t be re-rendered. A JSX node like <List items={visibleTodos} /> is an object like { type: List, props: { items: visibleTodos } } . Creating this object is very cheap, but React doesn’t know whether its contents is the same as last time or not. This is why by default, React will re-render the List component. However, if React sees the same exact JSX as during the previous render, it won’t try to re-render your component. This is because JSX nodes are immutable. A JSX node object could not have changed over time, so React knows it’s safe to skip a re-render. However, for this to work, the node has to actually be the same object , not merely look the same in code. This is what useMemo does in this example. Manually wrapping JSX nodes into useMemo is not convenient. For example, you can’t do this conditionally. This is usually why you would wrap components with memo instead of wrapping JSX nodes.

However, since useMemo is performance optimization, not a semantic guarantee, React may throw away the cached value if there is a specific reason to do that . This will also cause the effect to re-fire, so it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency by moving your object inside the Effect: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [message, setMessage] = useState(''); useEffect(() => { const options = { // ✅ No need for useMemo or object dependencies! serverUrl: ' roomId: roomId } const connection = createConnection(options); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes // ... </code_snipet> Now your code is simpler and doesn’t need useMemo .

Memoizing a dependency of another Hook Suppose you have a calculation that depends on an object created directly in the component body: <code_snipet> function Dropdown({ allItems, text }) { const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text }; const visibleItems = useMemo(() => { return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions); }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // 🚩 Caution: Dependency on an object created in the component body // ... </code_snipet> Depending on an object like this defeats the point of memoization.

The lines of code creating the searchOptions object will also run on every re-render. Since searchOptions is a dependency of your useMemo call, and it’s different every time, React knows the dependencies are different, and recalculate searchItems every time. To fix this, you could memoize the searchOptions object itself before passing it as a dependency: <code_snipet> function Dropdown({ allItems, text }) { const searchOptions = useMemo(() => { return { matchMode: 'whole-word', text }; }, [text]); // ✅ Only changes when text changes const visibleItems = useMemo(() => { return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions); }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or searchOptions changes // ... </code_snipet> In the example above, if the text did not change, the searchOptions object also won’t change. However, an even better fix is to move the searchOptions object declaration inside of the useMemo calculation function: <code_snipet> function Dropdown({ allItems, text }) { const visibleItems = useMemo(() => { const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text }; return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions); }, [allItems, text]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or text changes // ... </code_snipet> Now your calculation depends on text directly (which is a string and can’t “accidentally” become different).

Memoizing functions is common enough that React has a built-in Hook specifically for that. Wrap your functions into useCallback instead of useMemo to avoid having to write an extra nested function: <code_snipet> export default function Page({ productId, referrer }) { const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => { post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', { referrer, orderDetails }); }, [productId, referrer]); return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;} </code_snipet> The two examples above are completely equivalent.

This development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component and calculation functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice and fix the mistake. For example, this impure calculation function mutates an array you received as a prop: <code_snipet> const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => { // 🚩 Mistake: mutating a prop todos.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' }); const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab); return filtered; }, [todos, tab]); </code_snipet> React calls your function twice, so you’d notice the todo is added twice. Your calculation shouldn’t change any existing objects, but it’s okay to change any new objects you created during the calculation. For example, if the filterTodos function always returns a different array, you can mutate that array instead: <code_snipet> const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => { const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab); // ✅ Correct: mutating an object you created during the calculation filtered.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' }); return filtered; }, [todos, tab]); </code_snipet> Read keeping components pure to learn more about purity.

Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the state JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler. If you need to guess the next state value, you can calculate it manually by calling the reducer yourself: <code_snipet> const action = { type: 'incremented_age' };dispatch(action);const nextState = reducer(state, action);console.log(state); // { age: 42 }console.log(nextState); // { age: 43 } </code_snipet> I’ve dispatched an action, but the screen doesn’t update React will ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state, as determined by an Object.is comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly: <code_snipet> function reducer(state, action) { switch (action.type) { case 'incremented_age': { // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object state.age++; return state; } case 'changed_name': { // 🚩 Wrong:\"),\n",

To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always updating objects in state and updating arrays in state instead of mutating them: <code_snipet> function reducer(state, action) { switch (action.type) { case 'incremented_age': { // ✅ Correct: creating a new object return { ...state, age: state.age + 1 }; } case 'changed_name': { // ✅ Correct: creating a new object return { ...state, name: action.nextName }; } // ... }} </code_snipet> A part of my reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching Make sure that every case branch copies all of the existing fields when returning the new state: <code_snipet> function reducer(state, action) { switch (action.type) { case 'incremented_age': { return { ...state, // Don't forget this! age: state.age + 1 }; } // ... </code_snipet> Without ...state above, the returned next state would only contain the age field and nothing else. My entire reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching If your state unexpectedly becomes undefined , you’re likely forgetting to return state in one of the cases, or your action type doesn’t match any of the case statements. To find why, throw an error outside the switch : <code_snipet> function reducer(state, action) { switch (action.type) { case 'incremented_age': { // ... } case 'edited_name': { // ... } } throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);} </code_snipet> You can also use a static type checker like TypeScript to catch such mistakes.

Parameters initialValue : The value you want the ref object’s current property to be initially. It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render. Returns useRef returns an object with a single property: current : Initially, it’s set to the initialValue you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current property. On the next renders, useRef will return the same object. Caveats You can mutate the ref.current property. Unlike state, it is mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering (for example, a piece of your state), then you shouldn’t mutate that object. When you change the ref.current property, React does not re-render your component. React is not aware of when you change it because a ref is a plain JavaScript object. Do not write or read ref.current during rendering, except for initialization. This makes your component’s behavior unpredictable. In Strict Mode, React will call your component function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. Each ref object will be created twice, but one of the versions will be discarded. If your component function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior.

On the next renders, useRef will return the same object. You can change its current property to store information and read it later. This might remind you of state , but there is an important difference. Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render. This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesn’t affect the visual output of your component. For example, if you need to store an interval ID and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its current property : <code_snipet> function handleStartClick() { const intervalId = setInterval(() => { // ... }, 1000); intervalRef.current = intervalId;} </code_snipet> Later, you can read that interval ID from the ref so that you can call clear that interval : <code_snipet> function handleStopClick() { const intervalId = intervalRef.current; clearInterval(intervalId);} </code_snipet> By using a ref, you ensure that: You can store information between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render). Changing it does not trigger a re-render (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render). The information is local to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared). Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render, so refs are not appropriate for storing information you want to display on the screen. Use state for that instead.

A stopwatch Example 1 of 2 : Click counter This component uses a ref to keep track of how many times the button was clicked.

This is because setting ref.current does not trigger a re-render. Information that’s used for rendering should be state instead. Next Example Pitfall Do not write or read ref.current during rendering. React expects that the body of your component behaves like a pure function : If the inputs ( props , state , and context ) are the same, it should return exactly the same JSX. Calling it in a different order or with different arguments should not affect the results of other calls. Reading or writing a ref during rendering breaks these expectations. <code_snipet> function MyComponent() { // ... // 🚩 Don't write a ref during rendering myRef.current = 123; // ... // 🚩 Don't read a ref during rendering return <h1>{myOtherRef.current}</h1>;} </code_snipet> You can read or write refs from event handlers or effects instead . <code_snipet> function MyComponent() { // ... useEffect(() => { // ✅ You can read or write refs in effects myRef.current = 123; }); // ... function handleClick() { // ✅ You can read or write refs in event handlers doSomething(myOtherRef.current); } // ...} </code_snipet> If you have to read or write something during rendering, use state instead.

The set function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies. Calling the set function during rendering is only allowed from within the currently rendering component. React will discard its output and immediately attempt to render it again with the new state.

Basic useState examples 1 . Counter (number) 2 . Text field (string) 3 . Checkbox (boolean) 4 . Form (two variables) Example 1 of 4 : Counter (number) In this example, the count state variable holds a number. Clicking the button increments it.

This handler calls setAge(age + 1) three times: <code_snipet> function handleClick() { setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1) setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1) setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)} </code_snipet> However, after one click, age will only be 43 rather than 45 ! This is because calling the set function does not update the age state variable in the already running code. So each setAge(age + 1) call becomes setAge(43) . To solve this problem, you may pass an updater function to setAge instead of the next state: <code_snipet> function handleClick() { setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(42 => 43) setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(43 => 44) setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(44 => 45)} </code_snipet> Here, a => a + 1 is your updater function.

It takes the pending state and calculates the next state from it. React puts your updater functions in a queue. Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order: a => a + 1 will receive 42 as the pending state and return 43 as the next state. a => a + 1 will receive 43 as the pending state and return 44 as the next state. a => a + 1 will receive 44 as the pending state and return 45 as the next state. There are no other queued updates, so React will store 45 as the current state in the end. By convention, it’s common to name the pending state argument for the first letter of the state variable name, like a for age . However, you may also call it like prevAge or something else that you find clearer. React may call your updaters twice in development to verify that they are pure. Deep Dive Is using an updater always preferred? Show Details You might hear a recommendation to always write code like setAge(a => a + 1) if the state you’re setting is calculated from the previous state. There is no harm in it, but it is also not always necessary. In most cases, there is no difference between these two approaches. React always makes sure that for intentional user actions, like clicks, the age state variable would be updated before the next click. This means there is no risk of a click handler seeing a “stale” age at the beginning of the event handler. However, if you do multiple updates within the same event, updaters can be helpful. They’re also helpful if accessing the state variable itself is inconvenient (you might run into this when optimizing re-renders). If you prefer consistency over slightly more verbose syntax, it’s reasonable to always write an updater if the state you’re setting is calculated from the previous state.

However, it also serves another purpose. You can reset a component’s state by passing a different key to a component. In this example, the Reset button changes the version state variable, which we pass as a key to the Form . When the key changes, React re-creates the Form component (and all of its children) from scratch, so its state gets reset. Read preserving and resetting state to learn more.

However, in rare cases you might want to adjust state in response to rendering — for example, you might want to change a state variable when a prop changes. In most cases, you don’t need this: If the value you need can be computed entirely from the current props or other state, remove that redundant state altogether. If you’re worried about recomputing too often, the useMemo Hook can help. If you want to reset the entire component tree’s state, pass a different key to your component. If you can, update all the relevant state in the event handlers. In the rare case that none of these apply, there is a pattern you can use to update state based on the values that have been rendered so far, by calling a set function while your component is rendering. Here’s an example. This CountLabel component displays the count prop passed to it: <code_snipet> export default function CountLabel({ count }) { return <h1>{count}</h1>} </code_snipet> Say you want to show whether the counter has increased or decreased since the last change. The count prop doesn’t tell you this — you need to keep track of its previous value. Add the prevCount state variable to track it. Add another state variable called trend to hold whether the count has increased or decreased. Compare prevCount with count , and if they’re not equal, update both prevCount and trend . Now you can show both the current count prop and how it has changed since the last render . App.js CountLabel.js CountLabel.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function CountLabel({ count }) { const [prevCount, setPrevCount] = useState(count); const [trend, setTrend] = useState(null); if (prevCount !== count) { setPrevCount(count); setTrend(count > prevCount ?

Otherwise, your component would re-render in a loop until it crashes. Also, you can only update the state of the currently rendering component like this. Calling the set function of another component during rendering is an error. Finally, your set call should still update state without mutation — this doesn’t mean you can break other rules of pure functions. This pattern can be hard to understand and is usually best avoided. However, it’s better than updating state in an effect. When you call the set function during render, React will re-render that component immediately after your component exits with a return statement, and before rendering the children. This way, children don’t need to render twice. The rest of your component function will still execute (and the result will be thrown away). If your condition is below all the Hook calls, you may add an early return; to restart rendering earlier. Troubleshooting I’ve updated the state, but logging gives me the old value Calling the set function does not change state in the running code : <code_snipet> function handleClick() { console.log(count); // 0 setCount(count + 1); // Request a re-render with 1 console.log(count); // Still 0! setTimeout(() => { console.log(count); // Also 0! }, 5000);} </code_snipet> This is because states behaves like a snapshot.

This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly: <code_snipet> obj.x = 10; // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing objectsetObj(obj); // 🚩 Doesn't do anything </code_snipet> You mutated an existing obj object and passed it back to setObj , so React ignored the update.

React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally setting state during render , so your component enters a loop: render, set state (which causes a render), render, set state (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler: <code_snipet> // 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during renderreturn <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handlerreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline functionreturn <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button> </code_snipet> If you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific set function call\"),\n",

My initializer or updater function runs twice In Strict Mode , React will call some of your functions twice instead of once: <code_snipet> function TodoList() { // This component function will run twice for every render. const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => { // This initializer function will run twice during initialization. return createTodos(); }); function handleClick() { setTodos(prevTodos => { // This updater function will run twice for every click. return [...prevTodos, createTodo()]; }); } // ... </code_snipet> This is expected and shouldn’t break your code. This development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and updater functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes. For example, this impure updater function mutates an array in state: <code_snipet> setTodos(prevTodos => { // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state prevTodos.push(createTodo());}); </code_snipet> Because React calls your updater function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by replacing the array instead of mutating it : <code_snipet> setTodos(prevTodos => { // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];}); </code_snipet> Now that this updater function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior.

You need to pass two functions as arguments: The subscribe function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes. The getSnapshot function should read a snapshot of the data from the store. See more examples below. Parameters subscribe : A function that takes a single callback argument and subscribes it to the store. When the store changes, it should invoke the provided callback , which will cause React to re-call getSnapshot and (if needed) re-render the component. The subscribe function should return a function that cleans up the subscription. getSnapshot : A function that returns a snapshot of the data in the store that’s needed by the component. While the store has not changed, repeated calls to getSnapshot must return the same value. If the store changes and the returned value is different (as compared by Object.is ), React re-renders the component. optional getServerSnapshot : A function that returns the initial snapshot of the data in the store. It will be used only during server rendering and during hydration of server-rendered content on the client. The server snapshot must be the same between the client and the server, and is usually serialized and passed from the server to the client.

If you omit this argument, rendering the component on the server will throw an error. Returns The current snapshot of the store which you can use in your rendering logic. Caveats The store snapshot returned by getSnapshot must be immutable. If the underlying store has mutable data, return a new immutable snapshot if the data has changed. Otherwise, return a cached last snapshot. If a different subscribe function is passed during a re-render, React will re-subscribe to the store using the newly passed subscribe function. You can prevent this by declaring subscribe outside the component. If the store is mutated during a non-blocking Transition update , React will fall back to performing that update as blocking. Specifically, for every Transition update, React will call getSnapshot a second time just before applying changes to the DOM. If it returns a different value than when it was called originally, React will restart the update from scratch, this time applying it as a blocking update, to ensure that every component on screen is reflecting the same version of the store. It’s not recommended to suspend a render based on a store value returned by useSyncExternalStore . The reason is that mutations to the external store cannot be marked as non-blocking Transition updates , so they will trigger the nearest Suspense fallback , replacing already-rendered content on screen with a loading spinner, which typically makes a poor UX. For example, the following are discouraged: <code_snipet> const LazyProductDetailPage = lazy(() => import('./ProductDetailPage.js'));function ShoppingApp() { const selectedProductId = useSyncExternalStore(...); // ❌ Calling `use` with a Promise dependent on `selectedProductId` const data = use(fetchItem(selectedProductId)) // ❌ Conditionally rendering a lazy component based on `selectedProductId` return selectedProductId != null ? <LazyProductDetailPage /> :\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"const data = use(fetchItem(selectedProductId)) // ❌ Conditionally rendering a lazy component based on `selectedProductId` return selectedProductId != null ? <LazyProductDetailPage /> : <FeaturedProducts />;} </code_snipet> Usage Subscribing to an external store Most of your React components will only read data from their props, state, and context. However, sometimes a component needs to read some data from some store outside of React that changes over time. This includes: Third-party state management libraries that hold state outside of React. Browser APIs that expose a mutable value and events to subscribe to its changes. Call useSyncExternalStore at the top level of your component to read a value from an external data store. <code_snipet> import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';import { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';function TodosApp() { const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot); // ...} </code_snipet> It returns the snapshot of the data in the store. You need to pass two functions as arguments: The subscribe function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes. The getSnapshot function should read a snapshot of the data from the store. React will use these functions to keep your component subscribed to the store and re-render it on changes. For example, in the sandbox below, todosStore is implemented as an external store that stores data outside of React. The TodosApp component connects to that external store with the useSyncExternalStore Hook. App.js todoStore.js App.js Reset Fork import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react'; import { todosStore } from './todoStore.js'; export default function TodosApp() { const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot); return ( <> <button onClick={() => todosStore.addTodo()}>Add todo</button> <hr /> <ul> {todos.map(todo => ( <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li> ))} </ul> </> ); } Show more Note When possible, we recommend\"),\n",

The useSyncExternalStore API is mostly useful if you need to integrate with existing non-React code. Subscribing to a browser API Another reason to add useSyncExternalStore is when you want to subscribe to some value exposed by the browser that changes over time. For example, suppose that you want your component to display whether the network connection is active. The browser exposes this information via a property called navigator.onLine . This value can change without React’s knowledge, so you should read it with useSyncExternalStore . <code_snipet> import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';function ChatIndicator() { const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot); // ...} </code_snipet> To implement the getSnapshot function, read the current value from the browser API: <code_snipet> function getSnapshot() { return navigator.onLine;} </code_snipet> Next, you need to implement the subscribe function. For example, when navigator.onLine changes, the browser fires the online and offline events on the window object. You need to subscribe the callback argument to the corresponding events, and then return a function that cleans up the subscriptions: <code_snipet> function subscribe(callback) { window.addEventListener('online', callback); window.addEventListener('offline', callback); return () => { window.removeEventListener('online', callback); window.removeEventListener('offline', callback); };} </code_snipet> Now React knows how to read the value from the external navigator.onLine API and how to subscribe to its changes.

Instead, you’ll typically call it from your own custom Hook. This lets you use the same external store from different components. For example, this custom useOnlineStatus Hook tracks whether the network is online: <code_snipet> import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';export function useOnlineStatus() { const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot); return isOnline;}function getSnapshot() { // ...}function subscribe(callback) { // ...} </code_snipet> Now different components can call useOnlineStatus without repeating the underlying implementation: App.js useOnlineStatus.js App.js Reset Fork import { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js'; function StatusBar() { const isOnline = useOnlineStatus(); return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>; } function SaveButton() { const isOnline = useOnlineStatus(); function handleSaveClick() { console.log('✅ Progress saved'); } return ( <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}> {isOnline ?

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='</button> ); } export default function App() { return ( <> <SaveButton /> <StatusBar /> </> ); } Show more Adding support for server rendering If your React app uses server rendering, your React components will also run outside the browser environment to generate the initial HTML. This creates a few challenges when connecting to an external store: If you’re connecting to a browser-only API, it won’t work because it does not exist on the server. If you’re connecting to a third-party data store, you’ll need its data to match between the server and client. To solve these issues, pass a getServerSnapshot function as the third argument to useSyncExternalStore : <code_snipet> import { useSyncExternalStore } from \\'react\\';export function useOnlineStatus() { const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot); return isOnline;}function getSnapshot() { return navigator.onLine;}function getServerSnapshot() { return true; // Always show \"Online\" for server-generated HTML}function subscribe(callback) { // ...} </code_snipet> The getServerSnapshot function is similar to getSnapshot , but it runs only in two situations: It runs on the server when generating the HTML. It runs on the client during hydration , i.e. when React takes the server HTML and makes it interactive. This lets you provide the initial snapshot value which will be used before the app becomes interactive. If there is no meaningful initial value for the server rendering, omit this argument to force rendering on the client. Note Make sure that getServerSnapshot returns the same exact data on the initial client render as it returned on the server. For example, if getServerSnapshot returned some prepopulated store content on the server, you need to transfer this content to the client. One way to do this is to emit a <script> tag during server rendering that sets a global like window.MY_STORE_DATA , and read from that global on the client in getServerSnapshot .

Your external store should provide instructions on how to do that. Troubleshooting I’m getting an error: “The result of getSnapshot should be cached” This error means your getSnapshot function returns a new object every time it’s called, for example: <code_snipet> function getSnapshot() { // 🔴 Do not return always different objects from getSnapshot return { todos: myStore.todos };} </code_snipet> React will re-render the component if getSnapshot return value is different from the last time. This is why, if you always return a different value, you will enter an infinite loop and get this error. Your getSnapshot object should only return a different object if something has actually changed. If your store contains immutable data, you can return that data directly: <code_snipet> function getSnapshot() { // ✅ You can return immutable data return myStore.todos;} </code_snipet> If your store data is mutable, your getSnapshot function should return an immutable snapshot of it. This means it does need to create new objects, but it shouldn’t do this for every single call. Instead, it should store the last calculated snapshot, and return the same snapshot as the last time if the data in the store has not changed. How you determine whether mutable data has changed depends on your mutable store. My subscribe function gets called after every re-render This subscribe function is defined inside a component so it is different on every re-render: <code_snipet> function ChatIndicator() { const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot); // 🚩 Always a different function, so React will resubscribe on every re-render function subscribe() { // ... } // ...} </code_snipet> React will resubscribe to your store if you pass a different subscribe function between re-renders.

Caveats useTransition is a Hook, so it can only be called inside components or custom Hooks. If you need to start a Transition somewhere else (for example, from a data library), call the standalone startTransition instead. You can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook value, try useDeferredValue instead. The function you pass to startTransition is called immediately, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform state updates in a setTimeout , for example, they won’t be marked as Transitions. You must wrap any state updates after any async requests in another startTransition to mark them as Transitions. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see Troubleshooting ). The startTransition function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.

Transition updates can’t be used to control text inputs. If there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that may be removed in a future release.

Notice that the pending “Total” state is shown while any requests are in progress, and the “Total” updates only after the final request is complete. Because the update is in an Action, the “quantity” can continue to be updated while the request is in progress. App.js Item.js Total.js api.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useTransition } from \"react\"; import { updateQuantity } from \"./api\"; import Item from \"./Item\"; import Total from \"./Total\"; export default function App({}) { const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1); const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); const updateQuantityAction = async newQuantity => { // To access the pending state of a transition, // call startTransition again. startTransition(async () => { const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity); startTransition(() => { setQuantity(savedQuantity); }); }); };'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"of a transition, // call startTransition again. startTransition(async () => { const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity); startTransition(() => { setQuantity(savedQuantity); }); }); }; return ( <div> <h1>Checkout</h1> <Item action={updateQuantityAction}/> <hr /> <Total quantity={quantity} isPending={isPending} /> </div> ); } Show more This is a basic example to demonstrate how Actions work, but this example does not handle requests completing out of order. When updating the quantity multiple times, it’s possible for the previous requests to finish after later requests causing the quantity to update out of order. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see Troubleshooting below). For common use cases, React provides built-in abstractions such as: useActionState <form> actions Server Functions These solutions handle request ordering for you. When using Transitions to build your own custom hooks or libraries that manage async state transitions, you have greater control over the request ordering, but you must handle it yourself. Next Example Exposing action prop from components You can expose an action prop from a component to allow a parent to call an Action. For example, this TabButton component wraps its onClick logic in an action prop: <code_snipet> export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) { const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); if (isActive) { return <b>{children}</b> } return ( <button onClick={() => { startTransition(() => { action(); }); }}> {children} </button> );} </code_snipet> Because the parent component updates its state inside the action , that state update gets marked as a Transition. This means you can click on “Posts” and then immediately click “Contact” and it does not block user interactions: App.js TabButton.js AboutTab.js PostsTab.js ContactTab.js TabButton.js Reset Fork import { useTransition } from 'react'; export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='App.js TabButton.js AboutTab.js PostsTab.js ContactTab.js TabButton.js Reset Fork import { useTransition } from \\'react\\'; export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) { const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); if (isActive) { return <b>{children}</b> } return ( <button onClick={() => { startTransition(() => { action(); }); }}> {children} </button> ); } Show more Displaying a pending visual state You can use the isPending boolean value returned by useTransition to indicate to the user that a Transition is in progress. For example, the tab button can have a special “pending” visual state: <code_snipet> function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) { const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); // ... if (isPending) { return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>; } // ... </code_snipet> Notice how clicking “Posts” now feels more responsive because the tab button itself updates right away: App.js TabButton.js AboutTab.js PostsTab.js ContactTab.js TabButton.js Reset Fork import { useTransition } from \\'react\\'; export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) { const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); if (isActive) { return <b>{children}</b> } if (isPending) { return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>; } return ( <button onClick={() => { startTransition(() => { action(); }); }}> {children} </button> ); } Show more Preventing unwanted loading indicators In this example, the PostsTab component fetches some data using use . When you click the “Posts” tab, the PostsTab component suspends , causing the closest loading fallback to appear: App.js TabButton.js App.js Reset Fork import { Suspense, useState } from \\'react\\'; import TabButton from \\'./TabButton.js\\'; import AboutTab from \\'./AboutTab.js\\'; import PostsTab from \\'./PostsTab.js\\'; import ContactTab from \\'./ContactTab.js\\'; export default function TabContainer() { const [tab, setTab] = useState(\\'about\\'); return ( <Suspense fallback={<h1>🌀'),\n",

If you add useTransition to TabButton , you can instead display the pending state in the tab button instead. Notice that clicking “Posts” no longer replaces the entire tab container with a spinner: App.js TabButton.js TabButton.js Reset Fork import { useTransition } from \\'react\\'; export default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) { const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); if (isActive) { return <b>{children}</b> } if (isPending) { return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>; } return ( <button onClick={() => { startTransition(() => { action(); }); }}> {children} </button> ); } Show more Read more about using Transitions with Suspense. Note Transitions only “wait” long enough to avoid hiding already revealed content (like the tab container). If the Posts tab had a nested <Suspense> boundary, the Transition would not “wait” for it. Building a Suspense-enabled router If you’re building a React framework or a router, we recommend marking page navigations as Transitions. <code_snipet> function Router() { const [page, setPage] = useState(\\'/\\'); const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); function navigate(url) { startTransition(() => { setPage(url); }); } // ... </code_snipet> This is recommended for three reasons:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"useState('/'); const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); function navigate(url) { startTransition(() => { setPage(url); }); } // ... </code_snipet> This is recommended for three reasons: Transitions are interruptible, which lets the user click away without waiting for the re-render to complete. Transitions prevent unwanted loading indicators, which lets the user avoid jarring jumps on navigation. Transitions wait for all pending actions which lets the user wait for side effects to complete before the new page is shown. Here is a simplified router example using Transitions for navigations. App.js Layout.js IndexPage.js ArtistPage.js Albums.js Biography.js Panel.js App.js Reset Fork import { Suspense, useState, useTransition } from 'react'; import IndexPage from './IndexPage.js'; import ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js'; import Layout from './Layout.js'; export default function App() { return ( <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}> <Router /> </Suspense> ); } function Router() { const [page, setPage] = useState('/'); const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); function navigate(url) { startTransition(() => { setPage(url); }); } let content; if (page === '/') { content = ( <IndexPage navigate={navigate} /> ); } else if (page === '/the-beatles') { content = ( <ArtistPage artist={{ id: 'the-beatles', name: 'The Beatles', }} /> ); } return ( <Layout isPending={isPending}> {content} </Layout> ); } function BigSpinner() { return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>; } Show more Note Suspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into Transitions by default. Displaying an error to users with an error boundary If a function passed to startTransition throws an error, you can display an error to your user with an error boundary . To use an error boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the useTransition in an error boundary.

If you want to run a Transition in response to typing, you have two options: You can declare two separate state variables: one for the input state (which always updates synchronously), and one that you will update in a Transition. This lets you control the input using the synchronous state, and pass the Transition state variable (which will “lag behind” the input) to the rest of your rendering logic. Alternatively, you can have one state variable, and add useDeferredValue which will “lag behind”'),\n",

Alternatively, you can have one state variable, and add useDeferredValue which will “lag behind” the real value. It will trigger non-blocking re-renders to “catch up” with the new value automatically. React doesn’t treat my state update as a Transition When you wrap a state update in a Transition, make sure that it happens during the startTransition call: <code_snipet> startTransition(() => { // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call setPage('/about');}); </code_snipet> The function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous. You can’t mark an update as a Transition like this: <code_snipet> startTransition(() => { // ❌ Setting state *after* startTransition call setTimeout(() => { setPage('/about'); }, 1000);}); </code_snipet> Instead, you could do this: <code_snipet> setTimeout(() => { startTransition(() => { // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call setPage('/about'); });}, 1000); </code_snipet> React doesn’t treat my state update after await as a Transition When you use await inside a startTransition function, the state updates that happen after the await are not marked as Transitions. You must wrap state updates after each await in a startTransition call: <code_snipet> startTransition(async () => { await someAsyncFunction(); // ❌ Not using startTransition after await setPage('/about');}); </code_snipet> However, this works instead: <code_snipet> startTransition(async () => { await someAsyncFunction(); // ✅ Using startTransition *after* await startTransition(() => { setPage('/about'); });}); </code_snipet> This is a JavaScript limitation due to React losing the scope of the async context. In the future, when AsyncContext is available, this limitation will be removed.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='will be removed. I want to call useTransition from outside a component You can’t call useTransition outside a component because it’s a Hook. In this case, use the standalone startTransition method instead. It works the same way, but it doesn’t provide the isPending indicator. The function I pass to startTransition executes immediately If you run this code, it will print 1, 2, 3: <code_snipet> console.log(1);startTransition(() => { console.log(2); setPage(\\'/about\\');});console.log(3); </code_snipet> It is expected to print 1, 2, 3. The function you pass to startTransition does not get delayed. Unlike with the browser setTimeout , it does not run the callback later. React executes your function immediately, but any state updates scheduled while it is running are marked as Transitions. You can imagine that it works like this: <code_snipet> // A simplified version of how React workslet isInsideTransition = false;function startTransition(scope) { isInsideTransition = true; scope(); isInsideTransition = false;}function setState() { if (isInsideTransition) { // ... schedule a Transition state update ... } else { // ... schedule an urgent state update ... }} </code_snipet> My state updates in Transitions are out of order If you await inside startTransition , you might see the updates happen out of order. In this example, the updateQuantity function simulates a request to the server to update the item’s quantity in the cart. This function artificially returns the every other request after the previous to simulate race conditions for network requests. Try updating the quantity once, then update it quickly multiple times. You might see the incorrect total: App.js Item.js Total.js api.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useTransition } from \"react\"; import { updateQuantity } from \"./api\"; import Item from \"./Item\"; import Total from \"./Total\"; export default function App({}) { const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1); const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();'),\n",

When this happens, React currently has no way to know the intended order. This is because the updates are scheduled asynchronously, and React loses context of the order across the async boundary. This is expected, because Actions within a Transition do not guarantee execution order. For common use cases, React provides higher-level abstractions like useActionState and <form> actions that handle ordering for you. For advanced use cases, you’ll need to implement your own queuing and abort logic to handle this. Previous useSyncExternalStore Next Components Copyright © Meta Platforms, Inc no uwu plz uwu?

Props optional key : Fragments declared with the explicit <Fragment> syntax may have keys. Caveats If you want to pass key to a Fragment, you can’t use the <>...</> syntax. You have to explicitly import Fragment from \\'react\\' and render <Fragment key={yourKey}>...</Fragment> . React does not reset state when you go from rendering <><Child /></> to [<Child />] or back, or when you go from rendering <><Child /></> to <Child /> and back. This only works a single level deep: for example, going from <><><Child /></></> to <Child /> resets the state. See the precise semantics here. Usage Returning multiple elements Use Fragment , or the equivalent <>...</> syntax, to group multiple elements together. You can use it to put multiple elements in any place where a single element can go. For example, a component can only return one element, but by using a Fragment you can group multiple elements together and then return them as a group: <code_snipet> function Post() { return ( <> <PostTitle /> <PostBody /> </> );} </code_snipet> Fragments are useful because grouping elements with a Fragment has no effect on layout or styles, unlike if you wrapped the elements in another container like a DOM element.

Assigning multiple elements to a variable Like any other element, you can assign Fragment elements to variables, pass them as props, and so on: <code_snipet> function CloseDialog() { const buttons = ( <> <OKButton /> <CancelButton /> </> ); return ( <AlertDialog buttons={buttons}> Are you sure you want to leave this page? </AlertDialog> );} </code_snipet> Grouping elements with text You can use Fragment to group text together with components: <code_snipet> function DateRangePicker({ start, end }) { return ( <> From <DatePicker date={start} /> to <DatePicker date={end} /> </> );} </code_snipet> Rendering a list of Fragments Here’s a situation where you need to write Fragment explicitly instead of using the <></> syntax. When you render multiple elements in a loop , you need to assign a key to each element. If the elements within the loop are Fragments, you need to use the normal JSX element syntax in order to provide the key attribute: <code_snipet> function Blog() { return posts.map(post => <Fragment key={post.id}> <PostTitle title={post.title} /> <PostBody body={post.body} /> </Fragment> );} </code_snipet> You can inspect the DOM to verify that there are no wrapper elements around the Fragment children: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { Fragment } from \\'react\\'; const posts = [ { id: 1, title: \\'An update\\', body: \"It\\'s been a while since I posted...\" }, {'),\n",

If you use a framework that calls createRoot for you, check its documentation for how to enable Strict Mode. Although the Strict Mode checks only run in development, they help you find bugs that already exist in your code but can be tricky to reliably reproduce in production. Strict Mode lets you fix bugs before your users report them. Note Strict Mode enables the following checks in development: Your components will re-render an extra time to find bugs caused by impure rendering. Your components will re-run Effects an extra time to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup. Your components will re-run ref callbacks an extra time to find bugs caused by missing ref cleanup. Your components will be checked for usage of deprecated APIs. All of these checks are development-only and do not impact the production build. Enabling Strict Mode for a part of the app You can also enable Strict Mode for any part of your application: <code_snipet> import { StrictMode } from 'react';function App() { return ( <> <Header /> <StrictMode> <main> <Sidebar /> <Content /> </main> </StrictMode> <Footer /> </> );} </code_snipet> In this example, Strict Mode checks will not run against the Header and Footer components. However, they will run on Sidebar and Content , as well as all of the components inside them, no matter how deep. Fixing bugs found by double rendering in development React assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs (props, state, and context). Components breaking this rule behave unpredictably and cause bugs. To help you find accidentally impure code, Strict Mode calls some of your functions (only the ones that should be pure) twice in development. This includes: Your component function body (only top-level logic, so this doesn’t include code inside event handlers) Functions that you\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"(only the ones that should be pure) twice in development. This includes: Your component function body (only top-level logic, so this doesn’t include code inside event handlers) Functions that you pass to useState , set functions , useMemo , or useReducer Some class component methods like constructor , render , shouldComponentUpdate ( see the whole list ) If a function is pure, running it twice does not change its behavior because a pure function produces the same result every time. However, if a function is impure (for example, it mutates the data it receives), running it twice tends to be noticeable (that’s what makes it impure!) This helps you spot and fix the bug early. Here is an example to illustrate how double rendering in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early. This StoryTray component takes an array of stories and adds one last “Create Story” item at the end: index.js App.js StoryTray.js StoryTray.js Reset Fork export default function StoryTray({ stories }) { const items = stories; items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' }); return ( <ul> {items.map(story => ( <li key={story.id}> {story.label} </li> ))} </ul> ); } There is a mistake in the code above. However, it is easy to miss because the initial output appears correct. This mistake will become more noticeable if the StoryTray component re-renders multiple times. For example, let’s make the StoryTray re-render with a different background color whenever you hover over it: index.js App.js StoryTray.js StoryTray.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function StoryTray({ stories }) { const [isHover, setIsHover] = useState(false); const items = stories; items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' }); return ( <ul onPointerEnter={() => setIsHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setIsHover(false)} style={{ backgroundColor: isHover ? '#ddd' : '#fff' }} > {items.map(story => ( <li key={story.id}> {story.label} </li> ))} </ul> ); } Show more Notice how every time you hover over\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"setIsHover(false)} style={{ backgroundColor: isHover ? '#ddd' : '#fff' }} > {items.map(story => ( <li key={story.id}> {story.label} </li> ))} </ul> ); } Show more Notice how every time you hover over the StoryTray component, “Create Story” gets added to the list again. The intention of the code was to add it once at the end. But StoryTray directly modifies the stories array from the props. Every time StoryTray renders, it adds “Create Story” again at the end of the same array. In other words, StoryTray is not a pure function—running it multiple times produces different results. To fix this problem, you can make a copy of the array, and modify that copy instead of the original one: <code_snipet> export default function StoryTray({ stories }) { const items = stories.slice(); // Clone the array // ✅ Good: Pushing into a new array items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' }); </code_snipet> This would make the StoryTray function pure. Each time it is called, it would only modify a new copy of the array, and would not affect any external objects or variables. This solves the bug, but you had to make the component re-render more often before it became obvious that something is wrong with its behavior. In the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode> : index.js App.js StoryTray.js StoryTray.js Reset Fork export default function StoryTray({ stories }) { const items = stories; items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' }); return ( <ul> {items.map(story => ( <li key={story.id}> {story.label} </li> ))} </ul> ); } Strict Mode always calls your rendering function twice, so you can see the mistake right away (“Create Story” appears twice). This lets you notice such mistakes early in the process.

Strict Mode made the same bug appear right away. Strict Mode helps you find bugs before you push them to your team and to your users. Read more about keeping components pure. Note If you have React DevTools installed, any console.log calls during the second render call will appear slightly dimmed. React DevTools also offers a setting (off by default) to suppress them completely. Fixing bugs found by re-running Effects in development Strict Mode can also help find bugs in Effects. Every Effect has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the component mounts (is added to the screen) and calls cleanup when the component unmounts (is removed from the screen). React then calls cleanup and setup again if its dependencies changed since the last render. When Strict Mode is on, React will also run one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every Effect. This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually. Here is an example to illustrate how re-running Effects in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early. Consider this example that connects a component to a chat: index.js App.js chat.js index.js Reset Fork import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'; import './styles.css';\"),\n",

To make the issue more obvious, let’s implement a feature. In the example below, roomId is not hardcoded. Instead, the user can select the roomId that they want to connect to from a dropdown. Click “Open chat” and then select different chat rooms one by one. Keep track of the number of active connections in the console: index.js App.js chat.js index.js Reset Fork import { createRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\'; import \\'./styles.css\\'; import App from \\'./App\\'; const root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")); root.render(<App />); You’ll notice that the number of open connections always keeps growing. In a real app, this would cause performance and network problems. The issue is that your Effect is missing a cleanup function: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); </code_snipet> Now that your Effect “cleans up” after itself and destroys the outdated connections, the leak is solved.

This is a hint that you’re missing a cleanup function. Strict Mode lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your Effect by adding a cleanup function in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the select box from before: index.js App.js chat.js index.js Reset Fork import { StrictMode } from \\'react\\'; import { createRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\'; import \\'./styles.css\\'; import App from \\'./App\\'; const root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")); root.render( <StrictMode> <App /> </StrictMode> ); Notice how the active connection count in the console doesn’t keep growing anymore. Without Strict Mode, it was easy to miss that your Effect needed cleanup. By running setup → cleanup → setup instead of setup for your Effect in development, Strict Mode made the missing cleanup logic more noticeable. Read more about implementing Effect cleanup. Fixing bugs found by re-running ref callbacks in development Strict Mode can also help find bugs in callbacks refs. Every callback ref has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the element is created (is added to the DOM) and calls cleanup when the element is removed (is removed from the DOM).

Reference <Suspense> Props children : The actual UI you intend to render. If children suspends while rendering, the Suspense boundary will switch to rendering fallback . fallback : An alternate UI to render in place of the actual UI if it has not finished loading. Any valid React node is accepted, though in practice, a fallback is a lightweight placeholder view, such as a loading spinner or skeleton. Suspense will automatically switch to fallback when children suspends, and back to children when the data is ready. If fallback suspends while rendering, it will activate the closest parent Suspense boundary. Caveats React does not preserve any state for renders that got suspended before they were able to mount for the first time. When the component has loaded, React will retry rendering the suspended tree from scratch. If Suspense was displaying content for the tree, but then it suspended again, the fallback will be shown again unless the update causing it was caused by startTransition or useDeferredValue . If React needs to hide the already visible content because it suspended again, it will clean up layout Effects in the content tree. When the content is ready to be shown again, React will fire the layout Effects again. This ensures that Effects measuring the DOM layout don’t try to do this while the content is hidden. React includes under-the-hood optimizations like Streaming Server Rendering and Selective Hydration that are integrated with Suspense.

In the example below, the Albums component suspends while fetching the list of albums.

Then, when the data loads, React hides the Loading fallback and renders the Albums component with data.

If you work with a designer, ask them where the loading states should be placed—it’s likely that they’ve already included them in their design wireframes. Showing stale content while fresh content is loading In this example, the SearchResults component suspends while fetching the search results.

Transitions mark the whole update as non-urgent so they are typically used by frameworks and router libraries for navigation. Deferred values, on the other hand, are mostly useful in application code where you want to mark a part of UI as non-urgent and let it “lag behind” the rest of the UI. Preventing already revealed content from hiding When a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense boundary switches to showing the fallback. This can lead to a jarring user experience if it was already displaying some content.

A component inside ArtistPage suspended, so the closest Suspense boundary started showing the fallback. The closest Suspense boundary was near the root, so the whole site layout got replaced by BigSpinner . To prevent this, you can mark the navigation state update as a Transition with startTransition : <code_snipet> function Router() { const [page, setPage] = useState('/'); function navigate(url) { startTransition(() => { setPage(url); }); } // ... </code_snipet> This tells React that the state transition is not urgent, and it’s better to keep showing the previous page instead of hiding any already revealed content.

Note Suspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into Transitions by default. Indicating that a Transition is happening In the above example, once you click the button, there is no visual indication that a navigation is in progress. To add an indicator, you can replace startTransition with useTransition which gives you a boolean isPending value.

However, if you navigate to a route with different parameters, you might want to tell React it is different content. You can express this with a key : <code_snipet> <ProfilePage key={queryParams.id} /> </code_snipet> Imagine you’re navigating within a user’s profile page, and something suspends. If that update is wrapped in a Transition, it will not trigger the fallback for already visible content. That’s the expected behavior. However, now imagine you’re navigating between two different user profiles. In that case, it makes sense to show the fallback. For example, one user’s timeline is different content from another user’s timeline. By specifying a key , you ensure that React treats different users’ profiles as different components, and resets the Suspense boundaries during navigation. Suspense-integrated routers should do this automatically. Providing a fallback for server errors and client-only content If you use one of the streaming server rendering APIs (or a framework that relies on them), React will also use your <Suspense> boundaries to handle errors on the server. If a component throws an error on the server, React will not abort the server render. Instead, it will find the closest <Suspense> component above it and include its fallback (such as a spinner) into the generated server HTML. The user will see a spinner at first. On the client, React will\"),\n",

The user will see a spinner at first. On the client, React will attempt to render the same component again. If it errors on the client too, React will throw the error and display the closest error boundary. However, if it does not error on the client, React will not display the error to the user since the content was eventually displayed successfully. You can use this to opt out some components from rendering on the server. To do this, throw an error in the server environment and then wrap them in a <Suspense> boundary to replace their HTML with fallbacks: <code_snipet> <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}> <Chat /></Suspense>function Chat() { if (typeof window === 'undefined') { throw Error('Chat should only render on the client.'); } // ...} </code_snipet> The server HTML will include the loading indicator. It will be replaced by the Chat component on the client. Troubleshooting How do I prevent the UI from being replaced by a fallback during an update? Replacing visible UI with a fallback creates a jarring user experience. This can happen when an update causes a component to suspend, and the nearest Suspense boundary is already showing content to the user. To prevent this from happening, mark the update as non-urgent using startTransition . During a Transition, React will wait until enough data has loaded to prevent an unwanted fallback from appearing: <code_snipet> function handleNextPageClick() { // If this update suspends, don't hide the already displayed content startTransition(() => { setCurrentPage(currentPage + 1); });} </code_snipet> This will avoid hiding existing content. However, any newly rendered Suspense boundaries will still immediately display fallbacks to avoid blocking the UI and let the user see the content as it becomes available.

API Reference APIs act act is a test helper to apply pending React updates before making assertions. <code_snipet> await act(async actFn) </code_snipet> To prepare a component for assertions, wrap the code rendering it and performing updates inside an await act() call. This makes your test run closer to how React works in the browser. Note You might find using act() directly a bit too verbose. To avoid some of the boilerplate, you could use a library like React Testing Library , whose helpers are wrapped with act() .

Reference await act(async actFn) Usage Rendering components in tests Dispatching events in tests Troubleshooting I’m getting an error: “The current testing environment is not configured to support act”(…)” Reference await act(async actFn) When writing UI tests, tasks like rendering, user events, or data fetching can be considered as “units” of interaction with a user interface. React provides a helper called act() that makes sure all updates related to these “units” have been processed and applied to the DOM before you make any assertions. The name act comes from the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern. <code_snipet> it ('renders with button disabled', async () => { await act(async () => { root.render(<TestComponent />) }); expect(container.querySelector('button')).toBeDisabled();}); </code_snipet> Note We recommend using act with await and an async function. Although the sync version works in many cases, it doesn’t work in all cases and due to the way React schedules updates internally, it’s difficult to predict when you can use the sync version. We will deprecate and remove the sync version in the future. Parameters async actFn : An async function wrapping renders or interactions for components being tested. Any updates triggered within the actFn , are added to an internal act queue, which are then flushed together to process and apply any changes to the DOM. Since it is async, React will also run any code that crosses an async boundary, and flush any updates scheduled. Returns act does not return anything. Usage When testing a component, you can use act to make assertions about its output. For example, let’s say we have this Counter component, the usage examples below show how to test it: <code_snipet> function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); const handleClick = () => { setCount(prev => prev + 1); } useEffect(() => { document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`; },\"),\n",

This ensures that the component is rendered and its effects are applied before making assertions. Using act ensures that all updates have been applied before we make assertions. Dispatching events in tests To test events, wrap the event dispatch inside act() : <code_snipet> import {act} from 'react';import ReactDOMClient from 'react-dom/client';import Counter from './Counter';it.only('can render and update a counter', async () => { const container = document.createElement('div'); document.body.appendChild(container); await act( async () => { ReactDOMClient.createRoot(container).render(<Counter />); }); // ✅ Dispatch the event inside act(). await act(async () => { button.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', { bubbles: true })); }); const button = container.querySelector('button'); const label = container.querySelector('p');\"),\n",

This ensures that all updates from the event are applied before making assertions. Pitfall Don’t forget that dispatching DOM events only works when the DOM container is added to the document. You can use a library like React Testing Library to reduce the boilerplate code. Troubleshooting I’m getting an error: “The current testing environment is not configured to support act”(…)” Using act requires setting global.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT=true in your test environment. This is to ensure that act is only used in the correct environment. If you don’t set the global, you will see an error like this: Console Warning: The current testing environment is not configured to support act(…) To fix, add this to your global setup file for React tests: <code_snipet> global.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT=true </code_snipet> Note In testing frameworks like React Testing Library , IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT is already set for you.

If getMetrics is called again with the same data , it will return the cached result instead of calling calculateMetrics(data) again. See more examples below. Parameters fn : The function you want to cache results for. fn can take any arguments and return any value. Returns cache returns a cached version of fn with the same type signature. It does not call fn in the process. When calling cachedFn with given arguments, it first checks if a cached result exists in the cache. If a cached result exists, it returns the result. If not, it calls fn with the arguments, stores the result in the cache, and returns the result. The only time fn is called is when there is a cache miss. Note The optimization of caching return values based on inputs is known as memoization . We refer to the function returned from cache as a memoized function. Caveats React will invalidate the cache for all memoized functions for each server request. Each call to cache creates a new function. This means that calling cache with the same function multiple times will return different memoized functions that do not share the same cache. cachedFn will also cache errors. If fn throws an error for certain arguments, it will be cached, and the same error is re-thrown when cachedFn is called with those same arguments. cache is for use in Server Components only.

In addition, Temperature creates a new memoized function each time the component is rendered which doesn’t allow for any cache sharing. To maximize cache hits and reduce work, the two components should call the same memoized function to access the same cache. Instead, define the memoized function in a dedicated module that can be import -ed across components. <code_snipet> // getWeekReport.jsimport {cache} from 'react';import {calculateWeekReport} from './report';export default cache(calculateWeekReport); </code_snipet> <code_snipet> // Temperature.jsimport getWeekReport from './getWeekReport';export default function Temperature({cityData}) { const report = getWeekReport(cityData); // ...} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> // Precipitation.jsimport getWeekReport from './getWeekReport';export default function Precipitation({cityData}) { const report = getWeekReport(cityData); // ...} </code_snipet> Here, both components call the same memoized function exported from ./getWeekReport.js to read and write to the same cache. Share a snapshot of data To share a snapshot of data between components, call cache with a data-fetching function like fetch . When multiple components make the same data fetch, only one request is made and the data returned is cached and shared across components. All components refer to the same snapshot of data across the server render. <code_snipet> import {cache} from 'react';import {fetchTemperature} from './api.js';const getTemperature = cache(async (city) => { return await fetchTemperature(city);});async function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) { const temperature = await getTemperature(city); // ...}async function MinimalWeatherCard({city}) { const temperature\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='await fetchTemperature(city);});async function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) { const temperature = await getTemperature(city); // ...}async function MinimalWeatherCard({city}) { const temperature = await getTemperature(city); // ...} </code_snipet> If AnimatedWeatherCard and MinimalWeatherCard both render for the same city , they will receive the same snapshot of data from the memoized function . If AnimatedWeatherCard and MinimalWeatherCard supply different city arguments to getTemperature , then fetchTemperature will be called twice and each call site will receive different data. The city acts as a cache key. Note Asynchronous rendering is only supported for Server Components. <code_snipet> async function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) { const temperature = await getTemperature(city); // ...} </code_snipet> Preload data By caching a long-running data fetch, you can kick off asynchronous work prior to rendering the component. <code_snipet> const getUser = cache(async (id) => { return await db.user.query(id);});async function Profile({id}) { const user = await getUser(id); return ( <section> <img src={user.profilePic} /> <h2>{user.name}</h2> </section> );}function Page({id}) { // ✅ Good: start fetching the user data getUser(id); // ... some computational work return ( <> <Profile id={id} /> </> );} </code_snipet> When rendering Page , the component calls getUser but note that it doesn’t use the returned data. This early getUser call kicks off the asynchronous database query that occurs while Page is doing other computational work and rendering children. When rendering Profile , we call getUser again. If the initial getUser call has already returned and cached the user data, when Profile asks and waits for this data , it can simply read from the cache without requiring another remote procedure call.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"another remote procedure call. If the initial data request hasn’t been completed, preloading data in this pattern reduces delay in data-fetching. Deep Dive Caching asynchronous work Show Details When evaluating an asynchronous function , you will receive a Promise for that work. The promise holds the state of that work ( pending , fulfilled , failed ) and its eventual settled result. In this example, the asynchronous function fetchData returns a promise that is awaiting the fetch . <code_snipet> async function fetchData() { return await fetch(` getData = cache(fetchData);async function MyComponent() { getData(); // ... some computational work await getData(); // ...} </code_snipet> In calling getData the first time, the promise returned from fetchData is cached. Subsequent look-ups will then return the same promise. Notice that the first getData call does not await whereas the second does. await is a JavaScript operator that will wait and return the settled result of the promise. The first getData call simply initiates the fetch to cache the promise for the second getData to look-up. If by the second call the promise is still pending , then await will pause for the result. The optimization is that while we wait on the fetch , React can continue with computational work, thus reducing the wait time for the second call . If the promise is already settled, either to an error or the fulfilled result, await will return that value immediately. In both outcomes, there is a performance benefit. Pitfall Calling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache. <code_snipet> import {cache} from 'react';const getUser = cache(async (userId) => { return await db.user.query(userId);});// 🚩 Wrong: Calling memoized function outside of component will not memoize.getUser('demo-id');async function DemoProfile() { // ✅ Good: `getUser` will memoize. const user = await getUser('demo-id'); return <Profile user={user} />;} </code_snipet> React only provides cache access to\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='function DemoProfile() { // ✅ Good: `getUser` will memoize. const user = await getUser(\\'demo-id\\'); return <Profile user={user} />;} </code_snipet> React only provides cache access to the memoized function in a component. When calling getUser outside of a component, it will still evaluate the function but not read or update the cache. This is because cache access is provided through a context which is only accessible from a component. Deep Dive When should I use cache , memo , or useMemo ? Show Details All mentioned APIs offer memoization but the difference is what they’re intended to memoize, who can access the cache, and when their cache is invalidated. useMemo In general, you should use useMemo for caching a expensive computation in a Client Component across renders. As an example, to memoize a transformation of data within a component. <code_snipet> \\'use client\\';function WeatherReport({record}) { const avgTemp = useMemo(() => calculateAvg(record), record); // ...}function App() { const record = getRecord(); return ( <> <WeatherReport record={record} /> <WeatherReport record={record} /> </> );} </code_snipet> In this example, App renders two WeatherReport s with the same record. Even though both components do the same work, they cannot share work. useMemo ’s cache is only local to the component. However, useMemo does ensure that if App re-renders and the record object doesn’t change, each component instance would skip work and use the memoized value of avgTemp . useMemo will only cache the last computation of avgTemp with the given dependencies. cache In general, you should use cache in Server Components to memoize work that can be shared across components. <code_snipet> const cachedFetchReport = cache(fetchReport);function WeatherReport({city}) { const report = cachedFetchReport(city); // ...}function App() { const city = \"Los Angeles\"; return ( <> <WeatherReport city={city} /> <WeatherReport city={city} /> </> );} </code_snipet> Re-writing the previous example'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='// ...}function App() { const city = \"Los Angeles\"; return ( <> <WeatherReport city={city} /> <WeatherReport city={city} /> </> );} </code_snipet> Re-writing the previous example to use cache , in this case the second instance of WeatherReport will be able to skip duplicate work and read from the same cache as the first WeatherReport . Another difference from the previous example is that cache is also recommended for memoizing data fetches , unlike useMemo which should only be used for computations. At this time, cache should only be used in Server Components and the cache will be invalidated across server requests. memo You should use memo to prevent a component re-rendering if its props are unchanged. <code_snipet> \\'use client\\';function WeatherReport({record}) { const avgTemp = calculateAvg(record); // ...}const MemoWeatherReport = memo(WeatherReport);function App() { const record = getRecord(); return ( <> <MemoWeatherReport record={record} /> <MemoWeatherReport record={record} /> </> );} </code_snipet> In this example, both MemoWeatherReport components will call calculateAvg when first rendered. However, if App re-renders, with no changes to record , none of the props have changed and MemoWeatherReport will not re-render. Compared to useMemo , memo memoizes the component render based on props vs. specific computations. Similar to useMemo , the memoized component only caches the last render with the last prop values. Once the props change, the cache invalidates and the component re-renders. Troubleshooting My memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments See prior mentioned pitfalls Calling different memoized functions will read from different caches.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"none of the above apply, it may be a problem with how React checks if something exists in cache. If your arguments are not primitives (ex. objects, functions, arrays), ensure you’re passing the same object reference. When calling a memoized function, React will look up the input arguments to see if a result is already cached. React will use shallow equality of the arguments to determine if there is a cache hit. <code_snipet> import {cache} from 'react';const calculateNorm = cache((vector) => { // ...});function MapMarker(props) { // 🚩 Wrong: props is an object that changes every render. const length = calculateNorm(props); // ...}function App() { return ( <> <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} /> <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} /> </> );} </code_snipet> In this case the two MapMarker s look like they’re doing the same work and calling calculateNorm with the same value of {x: 10, y: 10, z:10} . Even though the objects contain the same values, they are not the same object reference as each component creates its own props object. React will call Object.is on the input to verify if there is a cache hit. <code_snipet> import {cache} from 'react';const calculateNorm = cache((x, y, z) => { // ...});function MapMarker(props) { // ✅ Good: Pass primitives to memoized function const length = calculateNorm(props.x, props.y, props.z); // ...}function App() { return ( <> <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} /> <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} /> </> );} </code_snipet> One way to address this could be to pass the vector dimensions to calculateNorm . This works because the dimensions themselves are primitives. Another solution may be to pass the vector object itself as a prop to the component. We’ll need to pass the same object to both component instances. <code_snipet> import {cache} from 'react';const calculateNorm = cache((vector) => { // ...});function MapMarker(props) { // ✅ Good: Pass the same `vector` object const length = calculateNorm(props.vector); // ...}function App() { const\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Call createContext outside of any components to create a context. <code_snipet> import { createContext } from 'react';const ThemeContext = createContext('light'); </code_snipet> See more examples below. Parameters defaultValue : The value that you want the context to have when there is no matching context provider in the tree above the component that reads context. If you don’t have any meaningful default value, specify null . The default value is meant as a “last resort” fallback. It is static and never changes over time. Returns createContext returns a context object. The context object itself does not hold any information. It represents which context other components read or provide. Typically, you will use SomeContext.Provider in components above to specify the context value, and call useContext(SomeContext) in components below to read it. The context object has a few properties: SomeContext.Provider lets you provide the context value to components. SomeContext.Consumer is an alternative and rarely used way to read the context value. SomeContext.Provider Wrap your components into a context provider to specify the value of this context for all components inside: <code_snipet> function App() { const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light'); // ... return ( <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}> <Page /> </ThemeContext.Provider> );} </code_snipet> Props value : The value that you want to pass to all the components reading this context inside this provider, no matter how deep. The context value can be of any type. A component calling useContext(SomeContext) inside of the provider receives the value of the innermost corresponding context provider above it. SomeContext.Consumer Before useContext existed, there was an older way to read context: <code_snipet> function Button() { // 🟡 Legacy way (not recommended) return ( <ThemeContext.Consumer> {theme => ( <button className={theme} /> )} </ThemeContext.Consumer> );} </code_snipet> Although this older way still works, newly\"),\n",

React will call the function you pass with the current context value determined by the same algorithm as useContext() does, and render the result you return from this function. React will also re-run this function and update the UI whenever the context from the parent components changes. Usage Creating context Context lets components pass information deep down without explicitly passing props. Call createContext outside any components to create one or more contexts. <code_snipet> import { createContext } from 'react';const ThemeContext = createContext('light');const AuthContext = createContext(null); </code_snipet> createContext returns a context object . Components can read context by passing it to useContext() : <code_snipet> function Button() { const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); // ...}function Profile() { const currentUser = useContext(AuthContext); // ...} </code_snipet> By default, the values they receive will be the default values you have specified when creating the contexts. However, by itself this isn’t useful because the default values never change. Context is useful because you can provide other, dynamic values from your components: <code_snipet> function App() { const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark'); const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({ name: 'Taylor' }); // ... return ( <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}> <AuthContext.Provider value={currentUser}> <Page /> </AuthContext.Provider> </ThemeContext.Provider> );} </code_snipet> Now the Page component and any components inside it, no matter how deep, will\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"<AuthContext.Provider value={currentUser}> <Page /> </AuthContext.Provider> </ThemeContext.Provider> );} </code_snipet> Now the Page component and any components inside it, no matter how deep, will “see” the passed context values. If the passed context values change, React will re-render the components reading the context as well. Read more about reading and providing context and see examples. Importing and exporting context from a file Often, components in different files will need access to the same context. This is why it’s common to declare contexts in a separate file. Then you can use the export statement to make context available for other files: <code_snipet> // Contexts.jsimport { createContext } from 'react';export const ThemeContext = createContext('light');export const AuthContext = createContext(null); </code_snipet> Components declared in other files can then use the import statement to read or provide this context: <code_snipet> // Button.jsimport { ThemeContext } from './Contexts.js';function Button() { const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); // ...} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> // App.jsimport { ThemeContext, AuthContext } from './Contexts.js';function App() { // ... return ( <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}> <AuthContext.Provider value={currentUser}> <Page /> </AuthContext.Provider> </ThemeContext.Provider> );} </code_snipet> This works similar to importing and exporting components. Troubleshooting I can’t find a way to change the context value Code like this specifies the default context value: <code_snipet> const ThemeContext = createContext('light'); </code_snipet> This value never changes. React only uses this value as a fallback if it can’t find a matching provider above. To make context change over time, add state and wrap components in a context provider.

Parameters load : A function that returns a Promise or another thenable (a Promise-like object with a then method). React will not call load until the first time you attempt to render the returned component. After React first calls load , it will wait for it to resolve, and then render the resolved value’s .default as a React component. Both the returned Promise and the Promise’s resolved value will be cached, so React will not call load more than once. If the Promise rejects, React will throw the rejection reason for the nearest Error Boundary to handle. Returns lazy returns a React component you can render in your tree. While the code for the lazy component is still loading, attempting to render it will suspend. Use <Suspense> to display a loading indicator while it’s loading. load function Parameters load receives no parameters. Returns You need to return a Promise or some other thenable (a Promise-like object with a then method). It needs to eventually resolve to an object whose .default property is a valid React component type, such as a function, memo , or a forwardRef component.

Wrap a component in memo to get a memoized version of that component. This memoized version of your component will usually not be re-rendered when its parent component is re-rendered as long as its props have not changed. But React may still re-render it: memoization is a performance optimization, not a guarantee. <code_snipet> import { memo } from 'react';const SomeComponent = memo(function SomeComponent(props) { // ...}); </code_snipet> See more examples below. Parameters Component : The component that you want to memoize. The memo does not modify this component, but returns a new, memoized component instead. Any valid React component, including functions and forwardRef components, is accepted. optional arePropsEqual : A function that accepts two arguments: the component’s previous props, and its new props. It should return true if the old and new props are equal: that is, if the component will render the same output and behave in the same way with the new props as with the old. Otherwise it should return false . Usually, you will not specify this function. By default, React will compare each prop with Object.is . Returns memo returns a new React component. It behaves the same as the component provided to memo except that React will not always re-render it when its parent is being re-rendered unless its props have changed. Usage Skipping re-rendering when props are unchanged React normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. With memo , you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props are the same as the old props. Such a component is said to be memoized . To memoize a component, wrap it in memo and use the value that it returns in place of your original component: <code_snipet> const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) { return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;});export\"),\n",

This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using memo , you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props haven’t changed. Even with memo , your component will re-render if its own state changes or if a context that it’s using changes. In this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop): App.js App.js Reset Fork import { memo, useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function MyApp() { const [name, setName] = useState(\\'\\'); const [address, setAddress] = useState(\\'\\'); return ( <> <label> Name{\\': \\'} <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} /> </label> <label> Address{\\': \\'} <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} /> </label> <Greeting name={name} /> </> ); } const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) { console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString()); return <h3>Hello{name && \\', \\'}{name}!</h3>; }); Show more Note You should only rely on memo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add memo to improve performance. Deep Dive Should you add memo everywhere?

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='or an entire section), memoization is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful. Optimizing with memo is only valuable when your component re-renders often with the same exact props, and its re-rendering logic is expensive. If there is no perceptible lag when your component re-renders, memo is unnecessary. Keep in mind that memo is completely useless if the props passed to your component are always different, such as if you pass an object or a plain function defined during rendering. This is why you will often need useMemo and useCallback together with memo . There is no benefit to wrapping a component in memo in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside of this approach is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that’s “always new” is enough to break memoization for an entire component. In practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles: When a component visually wraps other components, let it accept JSX as children. This way, when the wrapper component updates its own state, React knows that its children don’t need to re-render. Prefer local state and don’t lift state up any further than necessary. For example, don’t keep transient state like forms and whether an item is hovered at the top of your tree or in a global state library. Keep your rendering logic pure. If re-rendering a component causes a problem or produces some noticeable visual artifact, it’s a bug in your component! Fix the bug instead of adding memoization. Avoid unnecessary Effects that update state. Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Avoid unnecessary Effects that update state. Most performance problems in React apps are caused by chains of updates originating from Effects that cause your components to render over and over. Try to remove unnecessary dependencies from your Effects. For example, instead of memoization, it’s often simpler to move some object or a function inside an Effect or outside the component. If a specific interaction still feels laggy, use the React Developer Tools profiler to see which components would benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it’s good to follow them in any case. In the long term, we’re researching doing granular memoization automatically to solve this once and for all. Updating a memoized component using state Even when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when its own state changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent. App.js App.js Reset Fork import { memo, useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function MyApp() { const [name, setName] = useState(\\'\\'); const [address, setAddress] = useState(\\'\\'); return ( <> <label> Name{\\': \\'} <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} /> </label> <label> Address{\\': \\'} <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} /> </label> <Greeting name={name} /> </> ); } const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) { console.log(\\'Greeting was rendered at\\', new Date().toLocaleTimeString()); const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState(\\'Hello\\'); return ( <> <h3>{greeting}{name && \\', \\'}{name}!</h3> <GreetingSelector value={greeting} onChange={setGreeting} /> </> ); }); function GreetingSelector({ value, onChange }) { return ( <> <label> <input type=\"radio\" checked={value === \\'Hello\\'} onChange={e => onChange(\\'Hello\\')} /> Regular greeting </label> <label> <input type=\"radio\" checked={value === \\'Hello and welcome\\'} onChange={e =>'),\n",

You may still see your component function being called an extra time, but the result will be discarded. Updating a memoized component using a context Even when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when a context that it’s using changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent. App.js App.js Reset Fork import { createContext, memo, useContext, useState } from \\'react\\'; const ThemeContext = createContext(null); export default function MyApp() { const [theme, setTheme] = useState(\\'dark\\'); function handleClick() { setTheme(theme === \\'dark\\' ? \\'light\\' : \\'dark\\'); } return ( <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}> <button onClick={handleClick}> Switch theme </button> <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" /> </ThemeContext.Provider> ); } const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) { console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString()); const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); return ( <h3 className={theme}>Hello, {name}!</h3> ); }); Show more To make your component re-render only when a part of some context changes, split your component in two. Read what you need from the context in the outer component, and pass it down to a memoized child as a prop. Minimizing props changes When you use memo , your component re-renders whenever any prop is not shallowly equal to what it was previously. This means that React compares every prop in your component with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. Note that Object.is(3, 3) is true , but Object.is({}, {}) is false . To get the most out of memo , minimize the times that'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"in your component with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. Note that Object.is(3, 3) is true , but Object.is({}, {}) is false . To get the most out of memo , minimize the times that the props change. For example, if the prop is an object, prevent the parent component from re-creating that object every time by using useMemo : <code_snipet> function Page() { const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor'); const [age, setAge] = useState(42); const person = useMemo( () => ({ name, age }), [name, age] ); return <Profile person={person} />;}const Profile = memo(function Profile({ person }) { // ...}); </code_snipet> A better way to minimize props changes is to make sure the component accepts the minimum necessary information in its props. For example, it could accept individual values instead of a whole object: <code_snipet> function Page() { const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor'); const [age, setAge] = useState(42); return <Profile name={name} age={age} />;}const Profile = memo(function Profile({ name, age }) { // ...}); </code_snipet> Even individual values can sometimes be projected to ones that change less frequently. For example, here a component accepts a boolean indicating the presence of a value rather than the value itself: <code_snipet> function GroupsLanding({ person }) { const hasGroups = person.groups !== null; return <CallToAction hasGroups={hasGroups} />;}const CallToAction = memo(function CallToAction({ hasGroups }) { // ...}); </code_snipet> When you need to pass a function to memoized component, either declare it outside your component so that it never changes, or useCallback to cache its definition between re-renders. Specifying a custom comparison function In rare cases it may be infeasible to minimize the props changes of a memoized component. In that case, you can provide a custom comparison function, which React will use to compare the old and new props instead of using shallow equality.

You might be surprised. When you do performance measurements, make sure that React is running in the production mode. Pitfall If you provide a custom arePropsEqual implementation, you must compare every prop, including functions. Functions often close over the props and state of parent components. If you return true when oldProps.onClick !== newProps.onClick , your component will keep “seeing” the props and state from a previous render inside its onClick handler, leading to very confusing bugs. Avoid doing deep equality checks inside arePropsEqual unless you are 100% sure that the data structure you’re working with has a known limited depth. Deep equality checks can become incredibly slow and can freeze your app for many seconds if someone changes the data structure later. Troubleshooting My component re-renders when a prop is an object, array, or function React compares old and new props by shallow equality: that is, it considers whether each new prop is reference-equal to the old prop.

Parameters action : A function that updates some state by calling one or more set functions . React calls action immediately with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the action function call as Transitions. Any async calls awaited in the action will be included in the transition, but currently require wrapping any set functions after the await in an additional startTransition (see Troubleshooting ). State updates marked as Transitions will be non-blocking and will not display unwanted loading indicators. . Returns startTransition does not return anything. Caveats startTransition does not provide a way to track whether a Transition is pending. To show a pending indicator while the Transition is ongoing, you need useTransition instead. You can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook return value, try useDeferredValue instead. The function you pass to startTransition is called immediately, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform state updates in a setTimeout , for example, they won’t be marked as Transitions. You must wrap any state updates after any async requests in another startTransition to mark them as Transitions. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see Troubleshooting ). A state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input state update. Transition updates can’t be used to control text inputs. If\"),\n",

Transition updates can’t be used to control text inputs. If there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that may be removed in a future release. Usage Marking a state update as a non-blocking Transition You can mark a state update as a Transition by wrapping it in a startTransition call: <code_snipet> import { startTransition } from 'react';function TabContainer() { const [tab, setTab] = useState('about'); function selectTab(nextTab) { startTransition(() => { setTab(nextTab); }); } // ...} </code_snipet> Transitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices. With a Transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish. Note startTransition is very similar to useTransition , except that it does not provide the isPending flag to track whether a Transition is ongoing. You can call startTransition when useTransition is not available. For example, startTransition works outside components, such as from a data library.

Like React Hooks, the function that calls use must be a Component or Hook. When called with a Promise, the use API integrates with Suspense and error boundaries . The component calling use suspends while the Promise passed to use is pending. If the component that calls use is wrapped in a Suspense boundary, the fallback will be displayed. Once the Promise is resolved, the Suspense fallback is replaced by the rendered components using the data returned by the use API. If the Promise passed to use is rejected, the fallback of the nearest Error Boundary will be displayed. See more examples below. Parameters resource : this is the source of the data you want to read a value from. A resource can be a Promise or a context . Returns The use API returns the value that was read from the resource like the resolved value of a Promise or context . Caveats The use API must be called inside a Component or a Hook. When fetching data in a Server Component , prefer async and await over use . async and await pick up rendering from the point where await was invoked, whereas use re-renders the component after the data is resolved. Prefer creating Promises in Server Components and passing them to Client Components over creating Promises in Client Components. Promises created in Client Components are recreated on every render. Promises passed from a Server Component to a Client Component are stable across re-renders. See this example .

Show Details A Promise can be passed from a Server Component to a Client Component and resolved in the Client Component with the use API.

This message will be displayed as a part of the Error that will be thrown if value is passed to a Client Component. lifetime : Any object that indicates how long value should be tainted. value will be blocked from being sent to any Client Component while this object still exists. For example, passing globalThis blocks the value for the lifetime of an app. lifetime is typically an object whose properties contains value . value : A string, bigint or TypedArray. value must be a unique sequence of characters or bytes with high entropy such as a cryptographic token, private key, hash, or a long password. value will be blocked from being sent to any Client Component.

Do not use taintUniqueValue to protect low-entropy values such as PIN codes or phone numbers. If any value in a request is controlled by an attacker, they could infer which value is tainted by enumerating all possible values of the secret. Usage Prevent a token from being passed to Client Components To ensure that sensitive information such as passwords, session tokens, or other unique values do not inadvertently get passed to Client Components, the taintUniqueValue function provides a layer of protection. When a value is tainted, any attempt to pass it to a Client Component will result in an error. The lifetime argument defines the duration for which the value remains tainted. For values that should remain tainted indefinitely, objects like globalThis or process can serve as the lifetime argument. These objects have a lifespan that spans the entire duration of your app’s execution. <code_snipet> import {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';experimental_taintUniqueValue( 'Do not pass a user password to the client.', globalThis, process.env.SECRET_KEY); </code_snipet> If the tainted value’s lifespan is tied to a object, the lifetime should be the object that encapsulates the value. This ensures the tainted value remains protected for the lifetime of the encapsulating object. <code_snipet> import {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';export async function getUser(id) { const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`; experimental_taintUniqueValue( 'Do not pass a user session token to the client.', user, user.session.token ); return user;} </code_snipet> In this example, the user object serves as the lifetime argument.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='the user object serves as the lifetime argument. If this object gets stored in a global cache or is accessible by another request, the session token remains tainted. Pitfall Do not rely solely on tainting for security. Tainting a value doesn’t block every possible derived value. For example, creating a new value by upper casing a tainted string will not taint the new value. <code_snipet> import {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from \\'react\\';const password = \\'correct horse battery staple\\';experimental_taintUniqueValue( \\'Do not pass the password to the client.\\', globalThis, password);const uppercasePassword = password.toUpperCase() // `uppercasePassword` is not tainted </code_snipet> In this example, the constant password is tainted. Then password is used to create a new value uppercasePassword by calling the toUpperCase method on password . The newly created uppercasePassword is not tainted. Other similar ways of deriving new values from tainted values like concatenating it into a larger string, converting it to base64, or returning a substring create untained values. Tainting only protects against simple mistakes like explicitly passing secret values to the client. Mistakes in calling the taintUniqueValue like using a global store outside of React, without the corresponding lifetime object, can cause the tainted value to become untainted. Tainting is a layer of protection; a secure app will have multiple layers of protection, well designed APIs, and isolation patterns. Deep Dive Using server-only and taintUniqueValue to prevent leaking secrets Show Details If you’re running a Server Components environment that has access to private keys or passwords such as database passwords, you have to be careful not to pass that to a Client Component. <code_snipet> export async function Dashboard(props) { // DO NOT DO THIS return <Overview password={process.env.API_PASSWORD} />;} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> \"use client\";import {useEffect} from \\'...\\'export async function'),\n",

If this API token can be used to access data this particular user shouldn’t have access to, it could lead to a data breach. Ideally, secrets like this are abstracted into a single helper file that can only be imported by trusted data utilities on the server. The helper can even be tagged with server-only to ensure that this file isn’t imported on the client. <code_snipet> import \"server-only\";export function fetchAPI(url) { const headers = { Authorization: process.env.API_PASSWORD }; return fetch(url, { headers });} </code_snipet> Sometimes mistakes happen during refactoring and not all of your colleagues might know about this. To protect against this mistakes happening down the line we can “taint” the actual password: <code_snipet> import \"server-only\";import {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from \\'react\\';experimental_taintUniqueValue( \\'Do not pass the API token password to the client. \\' + \\'Instead do all fetches on the server.\\' process, process.env.API_PASSWORD); </code_snipet> Now whenever anyone tries to pass this password to a Client Component, or send the password to a Client Component with a Server Function, an error will be thrown with message you defined when you called taintUniqueValue .

If you pass a number, like width: 100 , React will automatically append px (“pixels”) to the value unless it’s a unitless property. We recommend using style only for dynamic styles where you don’t know the style values ahead of time. In other cases, applying plain CSS classes with className is more efficient. Read more about className and style . These standard DOM props are also supported for all built-in components: accessKey : A string. Specifies a keyboard shortcut for the element. Not generally recommended. aria-* : ARIA attributes let you specify the accessibility tree information for this element. See ARIA attributes for a complete reference. In React, all ARIA attribute names are exactly the same as in HTML. autoCapitalize : A string. Specifies whether and how the user input should be capitalized. className : A string. Specifies the element’s CSS class name. Read more about applying CSS styles. contentEditable : A boolean. If true , the browser lets the user edit the rendered element directly.

React warns if you try to pass React children to an element with contentEditable={true} because React will not be able to update its content after user edits. data-* : Data attributes let you attach some string data to the element, for example data-fruit=\"banana\" . In React, they are not commonly used because you would usually read data from props or state instead. dir : Either \\'ltr\\' or \\'rtl\\' . Specifies the text direction of the element. draggable : A boolean. Specifies whether the element is draggable. Part of HTML Drag and Drop API. enterKeyHint : A string. Specifies which action to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards. htmlFor : A string. For <label> and <output> , lets you associate the label with some control. Same as for HTML attribute. React uses the standard DOM property names ( htmlFor ) instead of HTML attribute names. hidden : A boolean or a string. Specifies whether the element should be hidden. id : A string. Specifies a unique identifier for this element, which can be used to find it later or connect it with other elements. Generate it with useId to avoid clashes between multiple instances of the same component. is : A string. If specified, the component will behave like a custom element. inputMode : A string.

Caveats You cannot pass both children and dangerouslySetInnerHTML at the same time. Some events (like onAbort and onLoad ) don’t bubble in the browser, but bubble in React. ref callback function Instead of a ref object (like the one returned by useRef ), you may pass a function to the ref attribute. <code_snipet> <div ref={(node) => { console.log('Attached', node); return () => { console.log('Clean up', node) }}}> </code_snipet> See an example of using the ref callback. When the <div> DOM node is added to the screen, React will call your ref callback with the DOM node as the argument. When that <div>\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='}}}> </code_snipet> See an example of using the ref callback. When the <div> DOM node is added to the screen, React will call your ref callback with the DOM node as the argument. When that <div> DOM node is removed, React will call your the cleanup function returned from the callback. React will also call your ref callback whenever you pass a different ref callback. In the above example, (node) => { ... } is a different function on every render. When your component re-renders, the previous function will be called with null as the argument, and the next function will be called with the DOM node. Parameters node : A DOM node. React will pass you the DOM node when the ref gets attached. Unless you pass the same function reference for the ref callback on every render, the callback will get temporarily cleanup and re-create during every re-render of the component. Note React 19 added cleanup functions for ref callbacks. To support backwards compatibility, if a cleanup function is not returned from the ref callback, node will be called with null when the ref is detached. This behavior will be removed in a future version. Returns optional cleanup function : When the ref is detached, React will call the cleanup function. If a function is not returned by the ref callback, React will call the callback again with null as the argument when the ref gets detached. This behavior will be removed in a future version. Caveats When Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function. When you pass a different ref callback, React will call the previous callback’s cleanup function if provided. If no cleanup function is defined, the ref callback will be called with null as the argument. The next function will be called with the DOM'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='call the previous callback’s cleanup function if provided. If no cleanup function is defined, the ref callback will be called with null as the argument. The next function will be called with the DOM node. React event object Your event handlers will receive a React event object. It is also sometimes known as a “synthetic event”. <code_snipet> <button onClick={e => { console.log(e); // React event object}} /> </code_snipet> It conforms to the same standard as the underlying DOM events, but fixes some browser inconsistencies. Some React events do not map directly to the browser’s native events. For example in onMouseLeave , e.nativeEvent will point to a mouseout event. The specific mapping is not part of the public API and may change in the future. If you need the underlying browser event for some reason, read it from e.nativeEvent . Properties React event objects implement some of the standard Event properties: bubbles : A boolean. Returns whether the event bubbles through the DOM. cancelable : A boolean. Returns whether the event can be canceled. currentTarget : A DOM node. Returns the node to which the current handler is attached in the React tree. defaultPrevented : A boolean. Returns whether preventDefault was called. eventPhase : A number. Returns which phase the event is currently in. isTrusted : A boolean. Returns whether the event was initiated by user. target : A DOM node. Returns the node on which the event has occurred (which could be a distant child). timeStamp : A number. Returns the time when the event occurred. Additionally, React event objects provide these properties: nativeEvent : A DOM Event . The original browser event object. Methods React event objects implement some of the standard Event methods: preventDefault() : Prevents the default browser action for the event. stopPropagation() : Stops the event propagation through the React tree. Additionally, React event objects provide these methods: isDefaultPrevented() : Returns a boolean value'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"action for the event. stopPropagation() : Stops the event propagation through the React tree. Additionally, React event objects provide these methods: isDefaultPrevented() : Returns a boolean value indicating whether preventDefault was called. isPropagationStopped() : Returns a boolean value indicating whether stopPropagation was called. persist() : Not used with React DOM. With React Native, call this to read event’s properties after the event. isPersistent() : Not used with React DOM. With React Native, returns whether persist has been called. Caveats The values of currentTarget , eventPhase , target , and type reflect the values your React code expects. Under the hood, React attaches event handlers at the root, but this is not reflected in React event objects. For example, e.currentTarget may not be the same as the underlying e.nativeEvent.currentTarget . For polyfilled events, e.type (React event type) may differ from e.nativeEvent.type (underlying type).

For example, className={\\'row \\' + (isSelected ? \\'selected\\': \\'\\')} will produce either className=\"row\" or className=\"row selected\" depending on whether isSelected is true . To make this more readable, you can use a tiny helper library like classnames : <code_snipet> import cn from \\'classnames\\';function Row({ isSelected }) { return ( <div className={cn(\\'row\\', isSelected && \\'selected\\')}> ... </div> );} </code_snipet> It is especially convenient if you have multiple conditional classes: <code_snipet> import cn from \\'classnames\\';function Row({ isSelected, size }) { return ( <div className={cn(\\'row\\', { selected: isSelected, large:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"convenient if you have multiple conditional classes: <code_snipet> import cn from 'classnames';function Row({ isSelected, size }) { return ( <div className={cn('row', { selected: isSelected, large: size === 'large', small: size === 'small', })}> ... </div> );} </code_snipet> Manipulating a DOM node with a ref Sometimes, you’ll need to get the browser DOM node associated with a tag in JSX. For example, if you want to focus an <input> when a button is clicked, you need to call focus() on the browser <input> DOM node. To obtain the browser DOM node for a tag, declare a ref and pass it as the ref attribute to that tag: <code_snipet> import { useRef } from 'react';export default function Form() { const inputRef = useRef(null); // ... return ( <input ref={inputRef} /> // ... </code_snipet> React will put the DOM node into inputRef.current after it’s been rendered to the screen. App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useRef } from 'react'; export default function Form() { const inputRef = useRef(null); function handleClick() { inputRef.current.focus(); } return ( <> <input ref={inputRef} /> <button onClick={handleClick}> Focus the input </button> </> ); } Show more Read more about manipulating DOM with refs and check out more examples. For more advanced use cases, the ref attribute also accepts a callback function. Dangerously setting the inner HTML You can pass a raw HTML string to an element like so: <code_snipet> const markup = { __html: '<p>some raw html</p>' };return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />; </code_snipet> This is dangerous. As with the underlying DOM innerHTML property, you must exercise extreme caution! Unless the markup is coming from a completely trusted source, it is trivial to introduce an XSS vulnerability this way. For example, if you use a Markdown library that converts Markdown to HTML, you trust that its parser doesn’t contain bugs, and the user only sees their own input, you can display the resulting HTML like this: package.json App.js\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='library that converts Markdown to HTML, you trust that its parser doesn’t contain bugs, and the user only sees their own input, you can display the resulting HTML like this: package.json App.js MarkdownPreview.js MarkdownPreview.js Reset Fork import { Remarkable } from \\'remarkable\\'; const md = new Remarkable(); function renderMarkdownToHTML(markdown) { // This is ONLY safe because the output HTML // is shown to the same user, and because you // trust this Markdown parser to not have bugs. const renderedHTML = md.render(markdown); return {__html: renderedHTML}; } export default function MarkdownPreview({ markdown }) { const markup = renderMarkdownToHTML(markdown); return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />; } Show more The {__html} object should be created as close to where the HTML is generated as possible, like the above example does in the renderMarkdownToHTML function. This ensures that all raw HTML being used in your code is explicitly marked as such, and that only variables that you expect to contain HTML are passed to dangerouslySetInnerHTML . It is not recommended to create the object inline like <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: markup}} /> . To see why rendering arbitrary HTML is dangerous, replace the code above with this: <code_snipet> const post = { // Imagine this content is stored in the database. content: `<img src=\"\" onerror=\\'alert(\"you were hacked\")\\'>`};export default function MarkdownPreview() { // 🔴 SECURITY HOLE: passing untrusted input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML const markup = { __html: post.content }; return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />;} </code_snipet> The code embedded in the HTML will run. A hacker could use this security hole to steal user information or to perform actions on their behalf. Only use dangerouslySetInnerHTML with trusted and sanitized data.

Usage Handle form submission on the client Pass a function to the action prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted. formData will be passed to the function as an argument so you can access the data submitted by the form.

This is beneficial to users who have a slow connection, device, or have JavaScript disabled and is similar to the way forms work when a URL is passed to the action prop. You can use hidden form fields to provide data to the <form> ’s action. The Server Function will be called with the hidden form field data as an instance of FormData . <code_snipet> import { updateCart } from \\'./lib.js\\';function AddToCart({productId}) { async function addToCart(formData) { \\'use server\\' const productId = formData.get(\\'productId\\') await updateCart(productId) } return ( <form action={addToCart}> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"productId\" value={productId} /> <button type=\"submit\">Add to Cart</button> </form> );} </code_snipet> In lieu of using hidden form fields to provide data to the <form> ’s action, you can call the bind method to supply it with extra arguments.

Optimistically updating form data The useOptimistic Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome. For example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the useOptimistic Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.

If you have your own custom Button React component, consider returning <button type=\"button\"> instead of <button> . Then, to be explicit, use <button type=\"submit\"> for buttons that are supposed to submit the form. Controlling an input with a state variable An input like <input /> is uncontrolled. Even if you pass an initial value like <input defaultValue=\"Initial text\" /> , your JSX only specifies the initial value. It does not control what the value should be right now. To render a controlled input, pass the value prop to it (or checked for checkboxes and radios). React will force the input to always have the value you passed. Usually, you would do this by declaring a state variable: <code_snipet> function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(\\'\\'); // Declare a state variable... // ... return ( <input value={firstName} // ...force the input\\'s value to match the state variable... onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} // ... and update the state variable on any edits! /> );} </code_snipet> A controlled input makes sense if you needed state anyway—for example, to re-render your UI on every edit: <code_snipet> function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(\\'\\');'),\n",

So if you pass a state variable as a value but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the onChange event handler, React will revert the input after every keystroke back to the value that you specified. Optimizing re-rendering on every keystroke When you use a controlled input, you set the state on every keystroke. If the component containing your state re-renders a large tree, this can get slow. There’s a few ways you can optimize re-rendering performance. For example, suppose you start with a form that re-renders all page content on every keystroke: <code_snipet> function App() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(''); return ( <> <form> <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} /> </form> <PageContent /> </> );} </code_snipet> Since <PageContent /> doesn’t rely on the input state, you can move the input state into its own component: <code_snipet> function App() { return ( <> <SignupForm /> <PageContent /> </> );}function SignupForm() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(''); return ( <form> <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} /> </form> );} </code_snipet> This significantly improves performance because now only SignupForm re-renders on every keystroke. If there is no way to avoid re-rendering (for example, if PageContent depends on the search input’s value), useDeferredValue lets you keep the controlled input responsive even in the middle of a large re-render.

Props <textarea> supports all common element props. You can make a text area controlled by passing a value prop: value : A string. Controls the text inside the text area. When you pass value , you must also pass an onChange handler that updates the passed value. If your <textarea> is uncontrolled, you may pass the defaultValue prop instead: defaultValue : A string. Specifies the initial value for a text area. These <textarea> props are relevant both for uncontrolled and controlled text areas: autoComplete : Either \\'on\\' or \\'off\\' . Specifies the autocomplete behavior. autoFocus : A boolean. If true , React will focus the element on mount. children : <textarea> does not accept children. To set the initial value, use defaultValue . cols : A number. Specifies the default width in average character widths. Defaults to 20 . disabled : A boolean. If true , the input will not be interactive and will appear dimmed. form : A string. Specifies the id of the <form> this input belongs to. If omitted, it’s the closest parent form. maxLength : A number. Specifies the maximum length of text. minLength : A number. Specifies the minimum length of text. name : A string. Specifies the name for this input that’s submitted with the form. onChange : An Event handler function. Required for controlled text areas. Fires immediately when the input’s value is changed by the user (for example, it fires on every keystroke).

Unlike the built-in invalid event, the React onInvalid event bubbles. onInvalidCapture : A version of onInvalid that fires in the capture phase. onSelect : An Event handler function. Fires after the selection inside the <textarea> changes. React extends the onSelect event to also fire for empty selection and on edits (which may affect the selection). onSelectCapture : A version of onSelect that fires in the capture phase. placeholder : A string. Displayed in a dimmed color when the text area value is empty. readOnly : A boolean. If true , the text area is not editable by the user. required : A boolean. If true , the value must be provided for the form to submit. rows : A number. Specifies the default height in average character heights. Defaults to 2 . wrap : Either 'hard' , 'soft' , or 'off' . Specifies how the text should be wrapped when submitting a form. Caveats Passing children like <textarea>something</textarea> is not allowed. Use defaultValue for initial content. If a text area receives a string value prop, it will be treated as controlled. A text area can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time. A text area cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime. Every controlled text area needs an onChange event handler that synchronously updates its backing value.

It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the text area.

This is because the order of stylesheets within the document is significant, so React needs to know how to order this stylesheet relative to others, which you specify using the precedence prop. If the precedence prop is omitted, there is no special behavior. If the <link> has an itemProp prop, there is no special behavior, because in this case it doesn’t apply to the document but instead represents metadata about a specific part of the page. If the <link> has an onLoad or onError prop, because in that case you are managing the loading of the linked resource manually within your React component. Special behavior for stylesheets In addition, if the <link> is to a stylesheet (namely, it has rel=\"stylesheet\" in its props), React treats it specially in the following ways: The component that renders <link> will suspend while the stylesheet is loading. If multiple components render links to the same stylesheet, React will de-duplicate them and only put a single link into the DOM. Two links are considered the same if they have the same href prop. There are two exception to this special behavior: If the link doesn’t have a precedence prop, there is no special behavior, because the order of stylesheets within the document is significant, so React needs to know how to order this stylesheet relative to others, which you specify using the precedence prop. If you supply any of the onLoad , onError , or disabled props, there is no special behavior, because these props indicate that you are managing the loading of the stylesheet manually within your component. This special treatment comes with two caveats: React will ignore changes to props after the link has been rendered. (React will issue a warning in development if this happens.)

Your component will suspend while the stylesheet is loading. You must supply the precedence prop, which tells React where to place this stylesheet relative to others — stylesheets with higher precedence can override those with lower precedence. Note When you want to use a stylesheet, it can be beneficial to call the preinit function.

Resource Preloading APIs These APIs can be used to make apps faster by pre-loading resources such as scripts, stylesheets, and fonts as soon as you know you need them, for example before navigating to another page where the resources will be used. React-based frameworks frequently handle resource loading for you, so you might not have to call these APIs yourself. Consult your framework’s documentation for details. prefetchDNS lets you prefetch the IP address of a DNS domain name that you expect to connect to. preconnect lets you connect to a server you expect to request resources from, even if you don’t know what resources you’ll need yet. preload lets you fetch a stylesheet, font, image, or external script that you expect to use. preloadModule lets you fetch an ESM module that you expect to use. preinit lets you fetch and evaluate an external script or fetch and insert a stylesheet. preinitModule lets you fetch and evaluate an ESM module.

A portal only changes the physical placement of the DOM node. In every other way, the JSX you render into a portal acts as a child node of the React component that renders it. For example, the child can access the context provided by the parent tree, and events bubble up from children to parents according to the React tree. Parameters children : Anything that can be rendered with React, such as a piece of JSX (e.g. <div /> or <SomeComponent /> ), a Fragment ( <>...</> ), a string or a number, or an array of these. domNode : Some DOM node, such as those returned by document.getElementById() . The node must already exist. Passing a different DOM node during an update will cause the portal content to be recreated. optional key : A unique string or number to be used as the portal’s key. Returns createPortal returns a React node that can be included into JSX or returned from a React component. If React encounters it in the render output, it will place the provided children inside the provided domNode . Caveats Events from portals propagate according to the React tree rather than the DOM tree. For example, if you click inside a portal, and the portal is wrapped in <div onClick> , that onClick handler will fire. If this causes issues, either stop the event propagation from inside the portal, or move the portal itself up in the React tree.

For instance, you may need to manage keyboard focus so that the user can move the focus in and out of the portal in a natural way. Follow the WAI-ARIA Modal Authoring Practices when creating modals. If you use a community package, ensure that it is accessible and follows these guidelines. Rendering React components into non-React server markup Portals can be useful if your React root is only part of a static or server-rendered page that isn’t built with React. For example, if your page is built with a server framework like Rails, you can create areas of interactivity within static areas such as sidebars.

For example, suppose you’re integrating with a non-React map widget and you want to render React content inside a popup. To do this, declare a popupContainer state variable to store the DOM node you’re going to render into: <code_snipet> const [popupContainer, setPopupContainer] = useState(null); </code_snipet> When you create the third-party widget, store the DOM node returned by the widget so you can render into it: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { if (mapRef.current === null) { const map = createMapWidget(containerRef.current); mapRef.current = map; const popupDiv = addPopupToMapWidget(map); setPopupContainer(popupDiv); }}, []); </code_snipet> This lets you use createPortal to render React content into popupContainer once it becomes available: <code_snipet> return ( <div style={{ width: 250, height: 250 }} ref={containerRef}> {popupContainer !== null && createPortal( <p>Hello from React!</p>, popupContainer )} </div>); </code_snipet> Here is a complete example you can play with: App.js map-widget.js App.js Reset Fork import { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react'; import { createPortal } from 'react-dom'; import { createMapWidget, addPopupToMapWidget } from './map-widget.js'; export default function Map() { const containerRef = useRef(null); const mapRef = useRef(null);\"),\n",

Use flushSync as last resort. See more examples below. Parameters callback : A function. React will immediately call this callback and flush any updates it contains synchronously. It may also flush any pending updates, or Effects, or updates inside of Effects. If an update suspends as a result of this flushSync call, the fallbacks may be re-shown. Returns flushSync returns undefined . Caveats flushSync can significantly hurt performance. Use sparingly. flushSync may force pending Suspense boundaries to show their fallback state. flushSync may run pending Effects and synchronously apply any updates they contain before returning. flushSync may flush updates outside the callback when necessary to flush the updates inside the callback. For example, if there are pending updates from a click, React may flush those before flushing the updates inside the callback. Usage Flushing updates for third-party integrations When integrating with third-party code such as browser APIs or UI libraries, it may be necessary to force React to flush updates. Use flushSync to force React to flush any state updates inside the callback synchronously: <code_snipet> flushSync(() => { setSomething(123);});// By this line, the DOM is updated. </code_snipet> This ensures that, by the time the next line of code runs, React has already updated the DOM. Using flushSync is uncommon, and using it often can significantly hurt the performance of your app. If your app only uses React APIs, and does not integrate with third-party libraries, flushSync should be unnecessary. However, it can be helpful for integrating with third-party code like browser APIs.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"for integrating with third-party code like browser APIs. Some browser APIs expect results inside of callbacks to be written to the DOM synchronously, by the end of the callback, so the browser can do something with the rendered DOM. In most cases, React handles this for you automatically. But in some cases it may be necessary to force a synchronous update. For example, the browser onbeforeprint API allows you to change the page immediately before the print dialog opens. This is useful for applying custom print styles that allow the document to display better for printing. In the example below, you use flushSync inside of the onbeforeprint callback to immediately “flush” the React state to the DOM. Then, by the time the print dialog opens, isPrinting displays “yes”: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; import { flushSync } from 'react-dom'; export default function PrintApp() { const [isPrinting, setIsPrinting] = useState(false); useEffect(() => { function handleBeforePrint() { flushSync(() => { setIsPrinting(true); }) } function handleAfterPrint() { setIsPrinting(false); } window.addEventListener('beforeprint', handleBeforePrint); window.addEventListener('afterprint', handleAfterPrint); return () => { window.removeEventListener('beforeprint', handleBeforePrint); window.removeEventListener('afterprint', handleAfterPrint); } }, []); return ( <> <h1>isPrinting: {isPrinting ? 'yes' : 'no'}</h1> <button onClick={() => window.print()}> Print </button> </> ); } Show more Without flushSync , the print dialog will display isPrinting as “no”. This is because React batches the updates asynchronously and the print dialog is displayed before the state is updated.

Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Returns createRoot returns an object with two methods: render and unmount . Caveats If your app is server-rendered, using createRoot() is not supported. Use hydrateRoot() instead. You’ll likely have only one createRoot call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you. When you want to render a piece of JSX in a different part of the DOM tree that isn’t a child of your component (for example, a modal or a tooltip), use createPortal instead of createRoot . root.render(reactNode) Call root.render to display a piece of JSX (“React node”) into the React root’s browser DOM node. <code_snipet> root.render(<App />); </code_snipet> React will display <App /> in the root , and take over managing the DOM inside it.

This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App /> , but you can also pass a React element constructed with createElement() , a string, a number, null , or undefined . Returns root.render returns undefined . Caveats The first time you call root.render , React will clear all the existing HTML content inside the React root before rendering the React component into it.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"will update the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest JSX you passed. React will decide which parts of the DOM can be reused and which need to be recreated by “matching it up” with the previously rendered tree. Calling render on the same root again is similar to calling the set function on the root component: React avoids unnecessary DOM updates. root.unmount() Call root.unmount to destroy a rendered tree inside a React root. <code_snipet> root.unmount(); </code_snipet> An app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to root.unmount . This is mostly useful if your React root’s DOM node (or any of its ancestors) may get removed from the DOM by some other code. For example, imagine a jQuery tab panel that removes inactive tabs from the DOM. If a tab gets removed, everything inside it (including the React roots inside) would get removed from the DOM as well. In that case, you need to tell React to “stop” managing the removed root’s content by calling root.unmount . Otherwise, the components inside the removed root won’t know to clean up and free up global resources like subscriptions. Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the root and “detach” React from the root DOM node, including removing any event handlers or state in the tree. Parameters root.unmount does not accept any parameters. Returns root.unmount returns undefined . Caveats Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node. Once you call root.unmount you cannot call root.render again on the same root. Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error. However, you can create a new root for the same DOM node after the previous root for that node has been unmounted.

From this point on, React will manage the DOM of your entire app. To add more components, nest them inside the App component. When you need to update the UI, each of your components can do this by using state. When you need to display extra content like a modal or a tooltip outside the DOM node, render it with a portal. Note When your HTML is empty, the user sees a blank page until the app’s JavaScript code loads and runs: <code_snipet> <div id=\"root\"></div> </code_snipet> This can feel very slow! To solve this, you can generate the initial HTML from your components on the server or during the build. Then your visitors can read text, see images, and click links before any of the JavaScript code loads. We recommend using a framework that does this optimization out of the box. Depending on when it runs, this is called server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG). Pitfall Apps using server rendering or static generation must call hydrateRoot instead of createRoot . React will then hydrate (reuse) the DOM nodes from your HTML instead of destroying and re-creating them.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"(reuse) the DOM nodes from your HTML instead of destroying and re-creating them. Rendering a page partially built with React If your page isn’t fully built with React , you can call createRoot multiple times to create a root for each top-level piece of UI managed by React. You can display different content in each root by calling root.render . Here, two different React components are rendered into two DOM nodes defined in the index.html file: index.js index.html Components.js index.js Reset Fork import './styles.css'; import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'; import { Comments, Navigation } from './Components.js'; const navDomNode = document.getElementById('navigation'); const navRoot = createRoot(navDomNode); navRoot.render(<Navigation />); const commentDomNode = document.getElementById('comments'); const commentRoot = createRoot(commentDomNode); commentRoot.render(<Comments />); You could also create a new DOM node with document.createElement() and add it to the document manually. <code_snipet> const domNode = document.createElement('div');const root = createRoot(domNode); root.render(<Comment />);document.body.appendChild(domNode); // You can add it anywhere in the document </code_snipet> To remove the React tree from the DOM node and clean up all the resources used by it, call root.unmount . <code_snipet> root.unmount(); </code_snipet> This is mostly useful if your React components are inside an app written in a different framework. Updating a root component You can call render more than once on the same root. As long as the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will preserve the state. Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated render calls every second in this example are not destructive: index.js App.js index.js Reset Fork import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'; import './styles.css'; import App from './App.js'; const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\"),\n",

Usually, your components will update state instead. Show a dialog for uncaught errors By default, React will log all uncaught errors to the console. To implement your own error reporting, you can provide the optional onUncaughtError root option: <code_snipet> import { createRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\';const root = createRoot( document.getElementById(\\'root\\'), { onUncaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => { console.error( \\'Uncaught error\\', error, errorInfo.componentStack ); } });root.render(<App />); </code_snipet> The onUncaughtError option is a function called with two arguments: The error that was thrown.

Parameters domNode : A DOM element that was rendered as the root element on the server. reactNode : The “React node” used to render the existing HTML. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App /> which was rendered with a ReactDOM Server method such as renderToPipeableStream(<App />) . optional options : An object with options for this React root. optional onCaughtError : Callback called when React catches an error in an Error Boundary. Called with the error caught by the Error Boundary, and an errorInfo object containing the componentStack . optional onUncaughtError : Callback called when an error is thrown and not caught by an Error Boundary. Called with the error that was thrown and an errorInfo object containing the componentStack . optional onRecoverableError : Callback called when React automatically recovers from errors. Called with the error React throws, and an errorInfo object containing the componentStack . Some recoverable errors may include the original error cause as error.cause . optional identifierPrefix : A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId . Useful to avoid conflicts\"),\n",

Some recoverable errors may include the original error cause as error.cause . optional identifierPrefix : A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId . Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as used on the server. Returns hydrateRoot returns an object with two methods: render and unmount . Caveats hydrateRoot() expects the rendered content to be identical with the server-rendered content. You should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them. In development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive. You’ll likely have only one hydrateRoot call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you. If your app is client-rendered with no HTML rendered already, using hydrateRoot() is not supported. Use createRoot() instead. root.render(reactNode) Call root.render to update a React component inside a hydrated React root for a browser DOM element. <code_snipet> root.render(<App />); </code_snipet> React will update <App /> in the hydrated root . See more examples below. Parameters reactNode : A “React node” that you want to update. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App /> , but you can also pass a React element constructed with createElement() , a string, a number, null , or undefined . Returns root.render returns undefined . Caveats If you call root.render before the root has finished hydrating, React will clear the existing server-rendered HTML content and switch the entire root to client rendering. root.unmount() Call root.unmount to destroy a rendered tree inside a React root. <code_snipet> root.unmount(); </code_snipet> An app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to root.unmount .

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"a rendered tree inside a React root. <code_snipet> root.unmount(); </code_snipet> An app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to root.unmount . This is mostly useful if your React root’s DOM node (or any of its ancestors) may get removed from the DOM by some other code. For example, imagine a jQuery tab panel that removes inactive tabs from the DOM. If a tab gets removed, everything inside it (including the React roots inside) would get removed from the DOM as well. You need to tell React to “stop” managing the removed root’s content by calling root.unmount . Otherwise, the components inside the removed root won’t clean up and free up resources like subscriptions. Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the root and “detach” React from the root DOM node, including removing any event handlers or state in the tree. Parameters root.unmount does not accept any parameters. Returns root.unmount returns undefined . Caveats Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node. Once you call root.unmount you cannot call root.render again on the root. Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error. Usage Hydrating server-rendered HTML If your app’s HTML was generated by react-dom/server , you need to hydrate it on the client. <code_snipet> import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <App />); </code_snipet> This will hydrate the server HTML inside the browser DOM node with the React component for your app. Usually, you will do it once at startup. If you use a framework, it might do this behind the scenes for you. To hydrate your app, React will “attach” your components’ logic to the initial generated HTML from the server. Hydration turns the initial HTML snapshot from the server into a fully interactive app that runs in the browser. index.js index.html App.js index.js Reset Fork\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='initial generated HTML from the server. Hydration turns the initial HTML snapshot from the server into a fully interactive app that runs in the browser. index.js index.html App.js index.js Reset Fork import \\'./styles.css\\'; import { hydrateRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\'; import App from \\'./App.js\\'; hydrateRoot( document.getElementById(\\'root\\'), <App /> ); You shouldn’t need to call hydrateRoot again or to call it in more places. From this point on, React will be managing the DOM of your application. To update the UI, your components will use state instead. Pitfall The React tree you pass to hydrateRoot needs to produce the same output as it did on the server. This is important for the user experience. The user will spend some time looking at the server-generated HTML before your JavaScript code loads. Server rendering creates an illusion that the app loads faster by showing the HTML snapshot of its output. Suddenly showing different content breaks that illusion. This is why the server render output must match the initial render output on the client. The most common causes leading to hydration errors include: Extra whitespace (like newlines) around the React-generated HTML inside the root node. Using checks like typeof window !== \\'undefined\\' in your rendering logic. Using browser-only APIs like window.matchMedia in your rendering logic. Rendering different data on the server and the client. React recovers from some hydration errors, but you must fix them like other bugs. In the best case, they’ll lead to a slowdown; in the worst case, event handlers can get attached to the wrong elements. Hydrating an entire document Apps fully built with React can render the entire document as JSX, including the <html> tag: <code_snipet> function App() { return ( <html> <head> <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" /> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link> <title>My app</title> </head> <body> <Router /> </body> </html>'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='/> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link> <title>My app</title> </head> <body> <Router /> </body> </html> );} </code_snipet> To hydrate the entire document, pass the document global as the first argument to hydrateRoot : <code_snipet> import { hydrateRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\';import App from \\'./App.js\\';hydrateRoot(document, <App />); </code_snipet> Suppressing unavoidable hydration mismatch errors If a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different between the server and the client (for example, a timestamp), you may silence the hydration mismatch warning. To silence hydration warnings on an element, add suppressHydrationWarning={true} : index.js index.html App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function App() { return ( <h1 suppressHydrationWarning={true}> Current Date: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()} </h1> ); } This only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to patch it up, so it may remain inconsistent until future updates. Handling different client and server content If you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that render something different on the client can read a state variable like isClient , which you can set to true in an Effect : index.js index.html App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"; export default function App() { const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false); useEffect(() => { setIsClient(true); }, []); return ( <h1> {isClient ? \\'Is Client\\' : \\'Is Server\\'} </h1> ); } This way the initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration. Pitfall This approach makes hydration slower because your components have to render twice. Be mindful of the user experience on slow connections. The JavaScript code may load significantly later than the initial HTML render, so rendering a different UI immediately after hydration may also feel jarring to the user. Updating a hydrated root component After the root has finished hydrating, you can call root.render to update the root React component. Unlike with createRoot , you don’t usually need to do this because the initial content was already rendered as HTML. If you call root.render at some point after hydration, and the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will preserve the state. Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated render calls every second in this example are not destructive: index.js index.html App.js index.js Reset Fork import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client'; import './styles.css'; import App from './App.js'; const root = hydrateRoot( document.getElementById('root'), <App counter={0} /> ); let i = 0; setInterval(() => { root.render(<App counter={i} />); i++; }, 1000); It is uncommon to call root.render on a hydrated root. Usually, you’ll update state inside one of the components instead. Show a dialog for uncaught errors By default, React will log all uncaught errors to the console. To implement your own error reporting, you can provide the optional onUncaughtError root option: <code_snipet> import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';const root = hydrateRoot( document.getElementById('root'), <App />, { onUncaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => { console.error( 'Uncaught error', error, errorInfo.componentStack ); } });root.render(<App />); </code_snipet> The onUncaughtError option is a function called with two arguments: The error that was thrown.

You can use this instead of onShellReady for crawlers and static generation. If you start streaming here, you won’t get any progressive loading. The stream will contain the final HTML. optional onError : A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether recoverable or not. By default, this only calls console.error . If you override it to log crash reports, make sure that you still call console.error . You can also use it to adjust the status code before the shell is emitted. optional onShellReady : A callback that fires right after the initial shell has been rendered. You can set the status code and call pipe here to start streaming. React will stream the additional content after the shell along with the inline <script> tags that replace the HTML loading fallbacks with the content. optional onShellError : A callback that fires if there was an error rendering the initial shell.

Deep Dive Reading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output Show Details The final asset URLs (like JavaScript and CSS files) are often hashed after the build.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='you might end up with styles.123456.css . Hashing static asset filenames guarantees that every distinct build of the same asset will have a different filename. This is useful because it lets you safely enable long-term caching for static assets: a file with a certain name would never change content. However, if you don’t know the asset URLs until after the build, there’s no way for you to put them in the source code. For example, hardcoding \"/styles.css\" into JSX like earlier wouldn’t work. To keep them out of your source code, your root component can read the real filenames from a map passed as a prop: <code_snipet> export default function App({ assetMap }) { return ( <html> <head> ... <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href={assetMap[\\'styles.css\\']}></link> ... </head> ... </html> );} </code_snipet> On the server, render <App assetMap={assetMap} /> and pass your assetMap with the asset URLs: <code_snipet> // You\\'d need to get this JSON from your build tooling, e.g. read it from the build output.const assetMap = { \\'styles.css\\': \\'/styles.123456.css\\', \\'main.js\\': \\'/main.123456.js\\'};app.use(\\'/\\', (request, response) => { const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, { bootstrapScripts: [assetMap[\\'main.js\\']], onShellReady() { response.setHeader(\\'content-type\\', \\'text/html\\'); pipe(response); } });}); </code_snipet> Since your server is now rendering <App assetMap={assetMap} /> , you need to render it with assetMap on the client too to avoid hydration errors. You can serialize and pass assetMap to the client like this: <code_snipet> // You\\'d need to get this JSON from your build tooling.const assetMap = { \\'styles.css\\': \\'/styles.123456.css\\', \\'main.js\\': \\'/main.123456.js\\'};app.use(\\'/\\', (request, response) => { const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, { // Careful: It\\'s safe to stringify() this because this data isn\\'t user-generated. bootstrapScriptContent: `window.assetMap = ${JSON.stringify(assetMap)};`, bootstrapScripts:'),\n",

This lets the client code read the same assetMap : <code_snipet> import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(document, <App assetMap={window.assetMap} />); </code_snipet> Both client and server render App with the same assetMap prop, so there are no hydration errors. Streaming more content as it loads Streaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Sidebar> <Friends /> <Photos /> </Sidebar> <Posts /> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> Imagine that loading data for <Posts /> takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, wrap Posts in a <Suspense> boundary: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Sidebar> <Friends /> <Photos /> </Sidebar> <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}> <Posts /> </Suspense> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> This tells React to start streaming the HTML before Posts loads its data.

You can further nest <Suspense> boundaries to create a more granular loading sequence: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}> <Sidebar> <Friends /> <Photos /> </Sidebar> <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}> <Posts /> </Suspense> </Suspense> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> In this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier. Only ProfileLayout and ProfileCover must finish rendering first because they are not wrapped in any <Suspense> boundary. However, if Sidebar , Friends , or Photos need to load some data, React will send the HTML for the BigSpinner fallback instead. Then, as more data becomes available, more content will continue to be revealed until all of it becomes visible.

Specifying what goes into the shell The part of your app outside of any <Suspense> boundaries is called the shell: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}> <Sidebar> <Friends /> <Photos /> </Sidebar> <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}> <Posts /> </Suspense> </Suspense> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> It determines the earliest loading state that the user may see: <code_snipet> <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <BigSpinner /></ProfileLayout> </code_snipet> If you wrap the whole app into a <Suspense> boundary at the root, the shell will only contain that spinner. However, that’s not a pleasant user experience because seeing a big spinner on the screen can feel slower and more annoying than waiting a bit more and seeing the real layout. This is why usually you’ll want to place the <Suspense> boundaries so that the shell feels minimal but complete —like a skeleton of the entire page layout. The onShellReady callback fires when the entire shell has been rendered. Usually, you’ll start streaming then: <code_snipet> const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onShellReady() { response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html'); pipe(response); }}); </code_snipet> By the time onShellReady fires, components in nested <Suspense> boundaries might still be loading data. Logging crashes on the server By default, all errors on the server are logged to console. You can override this behavior to log crash reports: <code_snipet> const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onShellReady() {\"),\n",

Recovering from errors inside the shell In this example, the shell contains ProfileLayout , ProfileCover , and PostsGlimmer : <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}> <Posts /> </Suspense> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> If an error occurs while rendering those components, React won’t have any meaningful HTML to send to the client. Override onShellError to send a fallback HTML that doesn’t rely on server rendering as the last resort: <code_snipet> const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onShellReady() { response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html'); pipe(response); }, onShellError(error) { response.statusCode = 500; response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html'); response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); }, onError(error) { console.error(error); logServerCrashReport(error); }}); </code_snipet> If there is an error while generating the shell, both onError and onShellError will fire. Use onError for error reporting and use onShellError to send the fallback HTML document. Your fallback HTML does not have to be an error page. Instead, you may include an alternative shell that renders your app on the client only. Recovering from errors outside the shell In this example, the <Posts /> component is wrapped in <Suspense> so it is not a part of the shell: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}> <Posts />\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"component is wrapped in <Suspense> so it is not a part of the shell: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}> <Posts /> </Suspense> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> If an error happens in the Posts component or somewhere inside it, React will try to recover from it: It will emit the loading fallback for the closest <Suspense> boundary ( PostsGlimmer ) into the HTML. It will “give up” on trying to render the Posts content on the server anymore. When the JavaScript code loads on the client, React will retry rendering Posts on the client. If retrying rendering Posts on the client also fails, React will throw the error on the client. As with all the errors thrown during rendering, the closest parent error boundary determines how to present the error to the user. In practice, this means that the user will see a loading indicator until it is certain that the error is not recoverable. If retrying rendering Posts on the client succeeds, the loading fallback from the server will be replaced with the client rendering output. The user will not know that there was a server error. However, the server onError callback and the client onRecoverableError callbacks will fire so that you can get notified about the error. Setting the status code Streaming introduces a tradeoff. You want to start streaming the page as early as possible so that the user can see the content sooner. However, once you start streaming, you can no longer set the response status code. By dividing your app into the shell (above all <Suspense> boundaries) and the rest of the content, you’ve already solved a part of this problem. If the shell errors, you’ll get the onShellError callback which lets you set the error status code. Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”. <code_snipet> const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onShellReady() {\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”. <code_snipet> const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onShellReady() { response.statusCode = 200; response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html'); pipe(response); }, onShellError(error) { response.statusCode = 500; response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html'); response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); }, onError(error) { console.error(error); logServerCrashReport(error); }}); </code_snipet> If a component outside the shell (i.e. inside a <Suspense> boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the onError callback will fire, but you will still get onShellReady instead of onShellError . This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, as described above. However, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code: <code_snipet> let didError = false;const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onShellReady() { response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200; response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html'); pipe(response); }, onShellError(error) { response.statusCode = 500; response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html'); response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); }, onError(error) { didError = true; console.error(error); logServerCrashReport(error); }}); </code_snipet> This will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell. Handling different errors in different ways You can create your own Error subclasses and use the instanceof operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom NotFoundError and throw it from your component. Then your onError , onShellReady , and onShellError callbacks can do something different\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom NotFoundError and throw it from your component.

Waiting for all content to load for crawlers and static generation Streaming offers a better user experience because the user can see the content as it becomes available. However, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively. You can wait for all the content to load using the onAllReady callback: <code_snipet> let didError = false;let isCrawler = // ... depends on your bot detection strategy ...const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onShellReady() { if (!isCrawler) { response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200; response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html'); pipe(response); } }, onShellError(error) { response.statusCode = 500; response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html'); response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); }, onAllReady() { if (isCrawler)\"),\n",

A crawler will receive the final HTML output after all the data loads. However, this also means that the crawler will have to wait for all data, some of which might be slow to load or error. Depending on your app, you could choose to send the shell to the crawlers too. Aborting server rendering You can force the server rendering to “give up” after a timeout: <code_snipet> const { pipe, abort } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, { // ...});setTimeout(() => { abort();}, 10000); </code_snipet> React will flush the remaining loading fallbacks as HTML, and will attempt to render the rest on the client.

Call renderToReadableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Readable Web Stream. <code_snipet> import { renderToReadableStream } from \\'react-dom/server\\';async function handler(request) { const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: [\\'/main.js\\'] }); return new Response(stream, { headers: { \\'content-type\\': \\'text/html\\' }, });} </code_snipet> On the client, call hydrateRoot to make the server-generated HTML interactive. See more examples below. Parameters reactNode : A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like <App /> . It is expected to represent the entire document, so the App component should render the <html> tag. optional options : An object with streaming options. optional bootstrapScriptContent : If specified, this string will be placed in an inline <script> tag. optional bootstrapScripts : An array of string URLs for the <script> tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the <script> that calls hydrateRoot . Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all. optional bootstrapModules : Like bootstrapScripts , but emits <script type=\"module\"> instead. optional identifierPrefix : A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId . Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as passed to hydrateRoot . optional namespaceURI : A string with the root namespace URI for the stream.

Pass ' for SVG or ' for MathML. optional nonce : A nonce string to allow scripts for script-src Content-Security-Policy . optional onError : A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether recoverable or not. By default, this only calls console.error . If you override it to log crash reports, make sure that you still call console.error . You can also use it to adjust the status code before the shell is emitted. optional progressiveChunkSize : The number of bytes in a chunk. Read more about the default heuristic. optional signal : An abort signal that lets you abort server rendering and render the rest on the client. Returns renderToReadableStream returns a Promise: If rendering the shell is successful, that Promise will resolve to a Readable Web Stream. If rendering the shell fails, the Promise will be rejected. Use this to output a fallback shell. The returned stream has an additional property: allReady : A Promise that resolves when all rendering is complete, including both the shell and all additional content. You can await stream.allReady before returning a response for crawlers and static generation. If you do that, you won’t get any progressive loading. The stream will contain the final HTML. Usage Rendering a React tree as HTML to a Readable Web Stream Call renderToReadableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Readable Web Stream: <code_snipet> import { renderToReadableStream } from 'react-dom/server';async function handler(request) { const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'] }); return new Response(stream, { headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' }, });} </code_snipet> Along with the root component , you need to provide a list of bootstrap <script> paths . Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag. For example, it might look like this: <code_snipet> export default function App() { return ( <html> <head>\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='paths . Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag. For example, it might look like this: <code_snipet> export default function App() { return ( <html> <head> <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" /> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link> <title>My app</title> </head> <body> <Router /> </body> </html> );} </code_snipet> React will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream: <code_snipet> <!DOCTYPE html><html> <!-- ... HTML from your components ... --></html><script src=\"/main.js\" async=\"\"></script> </code_snipet> On the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot : <code_snipet> import { hydrateRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\';import App from \\'./App.js\\';hydrateRoot(document, <App />); </code_snipet> This will attach event listeners to the server-generated HTML and make it interactive. Deep Dive Reading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output Show Details The final asset URLs (like JavaScript and CSS files) are often hashed after the build. For example, instead of styles.css you might end up with styles.123456.css . Hashing static asset filenames guarantees that every distinct build of the same asset will have a different filename. This is useful because it lets you safely enable long-term caching for static assets: a file with a certain name would never change content. However, if you don’t know the asset URLs until after the build, there’s no way for you to put them in the source code. For example, hardcoding \"/styles.css\" into JSX like earlier wouldn’t work. To keep them out of your source code, your root component can read the real filenames from a map passed as a prop: <code_snipet> export default function App({ assetMap }) { return ( <html> <head> <title>My app</title> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href={assetMap[\\'styles.css\\']}></link> </head> ... </html> );}'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='as a prop: <code_snipet> export default function App({ assetMap }) { return ( <html> <head> <title>My app</title> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href={assetMap[\\'styles.css\\']}></link> </head> ... </html> );} </code_snipet> On the server, render <App assetMap={assetMap} /> and pass your assetMap with the asset URLs: <code_snipet> // You\\'d need to get this JSON from your build tooling, e.g. read it from the build output.const assetMap = { \\'styles.css\\': \\'/styles.123456.css\\', \\'main.js\\': \\'/main.123456.js\\'};async function handler(request) { const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, { bootstrapScripts: [assetMap[\\'/main.js\\']] }); return new Response(stream, { headers: { \\'content-type\\': \\'text/html\\' }, });} </code_snipet> Since your server is now rendering <App assetMap={assetMap} /> , you need to render it with assetMap on the client too to avoid hydration errors. You can serialize and pass assetMap to the client like this: <code_snipet> // You\\'d need to get this JSON from your build tooling.const assetMap = { \\'styles.css\\': \\'/styles.123456.css\\', \\'main.js\\': \\'/main.123456.js\\'};async function handler(request) { const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, { // Careful: It\\'s safe to stringify() this because this data isn\\'t user-generated. bootstrapScriptContent: `window.assetMap = ${JSON.stringify(assetMap)};`, bootstrapScripts: [assetMap[\\'/main.js\\']], }); return new Response(stream, { headers: { \\'content-type\\': \\'text/html\\' }, });} </code_snipet> In the example above, the bootstrapScriptContent option adds an extra inline <script> tag that sets the global window.assetMap variable on the client. This lets the client code read the same assetMap : <code_snipet> import { hydrateRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\';import App from \\'./App.js\\';hydrateRoot(document, <App assetMap={window.assetMap} />); </code_snipet> Both client and server render App with the same assetMap prop, so there are no hydration errors.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='<App assetMap={window.assetMap} />); </code_snipet> Both client and server render App with the same assetMap prop, so there are no hydration errors. Streaming more content as it loads Streaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Sidebar> <Friends /> <Photos /> </Sidebar> <Posts /> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> Imagine that loading data for <Posts /> takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, wrap Posts in a <Suspense> boundary: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Sidebar> <Friends /> <Photos /> </Sidebar> <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}> <Posts /> </Suspense> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> This tells React to start streaming the HTML before Posts loads its data. React will send the HTML for the loading fallback ( PostsGlimmer ) first, and then, when Posts finishes loading its data, React will send the remaining HTML along with an inline <script> tag that replaces the loading fallback with that HTML. From the user’s perspective, the page will first appear with the PostsGlimmer , later replaced by the Posts . You can further nest <Suspense> boundaries to create a more granular loading sequence: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}> <Sidebar> <Friends /> <Photos /> </Sidebar> <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}> <Posts /> </Suspense> </Suspense> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> In this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"{ status: 500, headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' }, }); }} </code_snipet> If a component outside the shell (i.e. inside a <Suspense> boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the onError callback will fire, but your code will continue running without getting into the catch block. This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, as described above. However, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code: <code_snipet> async function handler(request) { try { let didError = false; const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onError(error) { didError = true; console.error(error); logServerCrashReport(error); } }); return new Response(stream, { status: didError ? 500 : 200, headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' }, }); } catch (error) { return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', { status: 500, headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' }, }); }} </code_snipet> This will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell. Handling different errors in different ways You can create your own Error subclasses and use the instanceof operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom NotFoundError and throw it from your component. Then you can save the error in onError and do something different before returning the response depending on the error type: <code_snipet> async function handler(request) { let didError = false; let caughtError = null; function getStatusCode() { if (didError) { if (caughtError instanceof NotFoundError) { return 404; } else { return 500; } } else { return 200; } } try { const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onError(error) { didError = true; caughtError = error;\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"} else { return 500; } } else { return 200; } } try { const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onError(error) { didError = true; caughtError = error; console.error(error); logServerCrashReport(error); } }); return new Response(stream, { status: getStatusCode(), headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' }, }); } catch (error) { return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', { status: getStatusCode(), headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' }, }); }} </code_snipet> Keep in mind that once you emit the shell and start streaming, you can’t change the status code. Waiting for all content to load for crawlers and static generation Streaming offers a better user experience because the user can see the content as it becomes available. However, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively. You can wait for all the content to load by awaiting the stream.allReady Promise: <code_snipet> async function handler(request) { try { let didError = false; const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'], onError(error) { didError = true; console.error(error); logServerCrashReport(error); } }); let isCrawler = // ... depends on your bot detection strategy ... if (isCrawler) { await stream.allReady; } return new Response(stream, { status: didError ? 500 : 200, headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' }, }); } catch (error) { return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', { status: 500, headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' }, }); }} </code_snipet> A regular visitor will get a stream of progressively loaded content.

Troubleshooting When a component suspends, the HTML always contains a fallback renderToString does not fully support Suspense. If some component suspends (for example, because it’s defined with lazy or fetches data), renderToString will not wait for its content to resolve. Instead, renderToString will find the closest <Suspense> boundary above it and render its fallback prop in the HTML. The content will not appear until the client code loads. To solve this, use one of the recommended streaming solutions. For server side rendering, they can stream content in chunks as it resolves on the server so that the user sees the page being progressively filled in before the client code loads.

Read more about the default heuristic. optional signal : An abort signal that lets you abort server rendering and render the rest on the client. Returns prerender returns a Promise: If rendering the is successful, the Promise will resolve to an object containing: prelude : a Web Stream of HTML. You can use this stream to send a response in chunks, or you can read the entire stream into a string. If rendering fails, the Promise will be rejected. Use this to output a fallback shell. Note When should I use prerender ? The static prerender API is used for static server-side generation (SSG). Unlike renderToString , prerender waits for all data to load before resolving. This makes it suitable for generating static HTML for a full page, including data that needs to be fetched using Suspense. To stream content as it loads, use a streaming server-side render (SSR) API like renderToReadableStream . Usage Rendering a React tree to a stream of static HTML Call prerender to render your React tree to static HTML into a Readable Web Stream: : <code_snipet> import { prerender } from \\'react-dom/static\\';async function handler(request) { const {prelude} = await prerender(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: [\\'/main.js\\'] }); return new Response(prelude, { headers: { \\'content-type\\': \\'text/html\\' }, });} </code_snipet> Along with the root component , you need to provide a list of bootstrap <script> paths . Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag. For example, it might look like this: <code_snipet> export default function App() { return ( <html> <head> <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" /> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link> <title>My app</title> </head> <body> <Router /> </body> </html> );} </code_snipet> React will inject the doctype and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='initial-scale=1\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link> <title>My app</title> </head> <body> <Router /> </body> </html> );} </code_snipet> React will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream: <code_snipet> <!DOCTYPE html><html> <!-- ... HTML from your components ... --></html><script src=\"/main.js\" async=\"\"></script> </code_snipet> On the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot : <code_snipet> import { hydrateRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\';import App from \\'./App.js\\';hydrateRoot(document, <App />); </code_snipet> This will attach event listeners to the static server-generated HTML and make it interactive. Deep Dive Reading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output Show Details The final asset URLs (like JavaScript and CSS files) are often hashed after the build. For example, instead of styles.css you might end up with styles.123456.css . Hashing static asset filenames guarantees that every distinct build of the same asset will have a different filename. This is useful because it lets you safely enable long-term caching for static assets: a file with a certain name would never change content. However, if you don’t know the asset URLs until after the build, there’s no way for you to put them in the source code. For example, hardcoding \"/styles.css\" into JSX like earlier wouldn’t work. To keep them out of your source code, your root component can read the real filenames from a map passed as a prop: <code_snipet> export default function App({ assetMap }) { return ( <html> <head> <title>My app</title> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href={assetMap[\\'styles.css\\']}></link> </head> ... </html> );} </code_snipet> On the server, render <App assetMap={assetMap} /> and pass your assetMap with the asset URLs: <code_snipet> // You\\'d need to get this JSON from your build tooling, e.g. read it from the build output.const assetMap = { \\'styles.css\\': \\'/styles.123456.css\\', \\'main.js\\':'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"with the asset URLs: <code_snipet> // You'd need to get this JSON from your build tooling, e.g. read it from the build output.const assetMap = { 'styles.css': '/styles.123456.css', 'main.js': '/main.123456.js'};async function handler(request) { const {prelude} = await prerender(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, { bootstrapScripts: [assetMap['/main.js']] }); return new Response(prelude, { headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' }, });} </code_snipet> Since your server is now rendering <App assetMap={assetMap} /> , you need to render it with assetMap on the client too to avoid hydration errors. You can serialize and pass assetMap to the client like this: <code_snipet> // You'd need to get this JSON from your build tooling.const assetMap = { 'styles.css': '/styles.123456.css', 'main.js': '/main.123456.js'};async function handler(request) { const {prelude} = await prerender(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, { // Careful: It's safe to stringify() this because this data isn't user-generated. bootstrapScriptContent: `window.assetMap = ${JSON.stringify(assetMap)};`, bootstrapScripts: [assetMap['/main.js']], }); return new Response(prelude, { headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' }, });} </code_snipet> In the example above, the bootstrapScriptContent option adds an extra inline <script> tag that sets the global window.assetMap variable on the client. This lets the client code read the same assetMap : <code_snipet> import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import App from './App.js';hydrateRoot(document, <App assetMap={window.assetMap} />); </code_snipet> Both client and server render App with the same assetMap prop, so there are no hydration errors. Rendering a React tree to a string of static HTML Call prerender to render your app to a static HTML string: <code_snipet> import { prerender } from 'react-dom/static';async function renderToString() { const {prelude} = await prerender(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'] }); const reader = stream.getReader(); let content = '';\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"} from 'react-dom/static';async function renderToString() { const {prelude} = await prerender(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'] }); const reader = stream.getReader(); let content = ''; while (true) { const {done, value} = await reader.read(); if (done) { return content; } content += Buffer.from(value).toString('utf8'); }} </code_snipet> This will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components. On the client, you will need to call hydrateRoot to hydrate that server-generated HTML and make it interactive. Waiting for all data to load prerender waits for all data to load before finishing the static HTML generation and resolving. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Sidebar> <Friends /> <Photos /> </Sidebar> <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}> <Posts /> </Suspense> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> Imagine that <Posts /> needs to load some data, which takes some time. Ideally, you’d want wait for the posts to finish so it’s included in the HTML. To do this, you can use Suspense to suspend on the data, and prerender will wait for the suspended content to finish before resolving to the static HTML. Note Only Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include: Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js Lazy-loading component code with lazy Reading the value of a Promise with use Suspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler. The exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.

Note When should I use prerenderToNodeStream ? The static prerenderToNodeStream API is used for static server-side generation (SSG). Unlike renderToString , prerenderToNodeStream waits for all data to load before resolving. This makes it suitable for generating static HTML for a full page, including data that needs to be fetched using Suspense. To stream content as it loads, use a streaming server-side render (SSR) API like renderToReadableStream .

Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag. For example, it might look like this: <code_snipet> export default function App() { return ( <html> <head> <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" /> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link> <title>My app</title> </head> <body> <Router /> </body> </html> );} </code_snipet> React will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream: <code_snipet> <!DOCTYPE html><html> <!-- ... HTML from your components ... --></html><script src=\"/main.js\" async=\"\"></script> </code_snipet> On the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot : <code_snipet> import { hydrateRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\';import App from \\'./App.js\\';hydrateRoot(document, <App />); </code_snipet> This will attach event listeners to the static server-generated HTML and make it interactive. Deep Dive Reading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output Show Details The final asset URLs (like JavaScript and CSS files) are often hashed after the build. For example, instead of styles.css you might end up with styles.123456.css . Hashing static asset filenames guarantees that every distinct build of the same asset will have a different filename. This is useful because it lets you safely enable long-term caching for static assets: a file with a certain name would never change content. However, if you don’t know the asset URLs until after the build, there’s no way for you to put them in the source code. For example, hardcoding \"/styles.css\" into JSX like earlier wouldn’t work. To keep them out of your source code, your root component can read the real filenames from a map passed as a prop: <code_snipet> export default function App({ assetMap }) { return ('),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='wouldn’t work. To keep them out of your source code, your root component can read the real filenames from a map passed as a prop: <code_snipet> export default function App({ assetMap }) { return ( <html> <head> <title>My app</title> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href={assetMap[\\'styles.css\\']}></link> </head> ... </html> );} </code_snipet> On the server, render <App assetMap={assetMap} /> and pass your assetMap with the asset URLs: <code_snipet> // You\\'d need to get this JSON from your build tooling, e.g. read it from the build output.const assetMap = { \\'styles.css\\': \\'/styles.123456.css\\', \\'main.js\\': \\'/main.123456.js\\'};app.use(\\'/\\', async (request, response) => { const { prelude } = await prerenderToNodeStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: [assetMap[\\'/main.js\\']] }); response.setHeader(\\'Content-Type\\', \\'text/html\\'); prelude.pipe(response);}); </code_snipet> Since your server is now rendering <App assetMap={assetMap} /> , you need to render it with assetMap on the client too to avoid hydration errors. You can serialize and pass assetMap to the client like this: <code_snipet> // You\\'d need to get this JSON from your build tooling.const assetMap = { \\'styles.css\\': \\'/styles.123456.css\\', \\'main.js\\': \\'/main.123456.js\\'};app.use(\\'/\\', async (request, response) => { const { prelude } = await prerenderToNodeStream(<App />, { // Careful: It\\'s safe to stringify() this because this data isn\\'t user-generated. bootstrapScriptContent: `window.assetMap = ${JSON.stringify(assetMap)};`, bootstrapScripts: [assetMap[\\'/main.js\\']], }); response.setHeader(\\'Content-Type\\', \\'text/html\\'); prelude.pipe(response);}); </code_snipet> In the example above, the bootstrapScriptContent option adds an extra inline <script> tag that sets the global window.assetMap variable on the client. This lets the client code read the same assetMap : <code_snipet> import { hydrateRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\';import App from \\'./App.js\\';hydrateRoot(document, <App assetMap={window.assetMap} />); </code_snipet> Both client and server'),\n",

Rendering a React tree to a string of static HTML Call prerenderToNodeStream to render your app to a static HTML string: <code_snipet> import { prerenderToNodeStream } from 'react-dom/static';async function renderToString() { const {prelude} = await prerenderToNodeStream(<App />, { bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'] }); return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { let data = ''; prelude.on('data', chunk => { data += chunk; }); prelude.on('end', () => resolve(data)); prelude.on('error', reject); });} </code_snipet> This will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components. On the client, you will need to call hydrateRoot to hydrate that server-generated HTML and make it interactive. Waiting for all data to load prerenderToNodeStream waits for all data to load before finishing the static HTML generation and resolving. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts: <code_snipet> function ProfilePage() { return ( <ProfileLayout> <ProfileCover /> <Sidebar> <Friends /> <Photos /> </Sidebar> <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}> <Posts /> </Suspense> </ProfileLayout> );} </code_snipet> Imagine that <Posts /> needs to load some data, which takes some time. Ideally, you’d want wait for the posts to finish so it’s included in the HTML. To do this, you can use Suspense to suspend on the data, and prerenderToNodeStream will wait for the suspended content to finish before resolving to the static HTML.

Writing idiomatic React code can help you write well organized, safe, and composable applications. These properties make your app more resilient to changes and makes it easier to work with other developers, libraries, and tools. These rules are known as the Rules of React . They are rules – and not just guidelines – in the sense that if they are broken, your app likely has bugs. Your code also becomes unidiomatic and harder to understand and reason about. We strongly recommend using Strict Mode alongside React’s ESLint plugin to help your codebase follow the Rules of React. By following the Rules of React, you’ll be able to find and address these bugs and keep your application maintainable. Components and Hooks must be pure Purity in Components and Hooks is a key rule of React that makes your app predictable, easy to debug, and allows React to automatically optimize your code. Components must be idempotent – React components are assumed to always return the same output with respect to their inputs – props, state, and context. Side effects must run outside of render – Side effects should not run in render, as React can render components multiple times to create the best possible user experience. Props and state are immutable – A component’s props and state are immutable snapshots with respect to a single render. Never mutate them directly. Return values and arguments to Hooks are immutable – Once values are passed to a Hook, you should not modify them. Like props in JSX, values become immutable when passed to a Hook. Values are immutable after being passed to JSX – Don’t mutate values after they’ve been used in JSX. Move the mutation before the JSX is created.

Props and state are immutable Don’t mutate Props Don’t mutate State Return values and arguments to Hooks are immutable Values are immutable after being passed to JSX Why does purity matter? One of the key concepts that makes React, React is purity . A pure component or hook is one that is: Idempotent – You always get the same result every time you run it with the same inputs – props, state, context for component inputs; and arguments for hook inputs. Has no side effects in render – Code with side effects should run separately from rendering . For example as an event handler – where the user interacts with the UI and causes it to update; or as an Effect – which runs after render. Does not mutate non-local values : Components and Hooks should never modify values that aren’t created locally in render. When render is kept pure, React can understand how to prioritize which updates are most important for the user to see first. This is made possible because of render purity: since components don’t have side effects in render , React can pause rendering components that aren’t as important to update, and only come back to them later when it’s needed. Concretely, this means that rendering logic can be run multiple times in a way that allows React to give your user a pleasant user experience. However, if your component has an untracked side effect – like modifying the value of a global variable during render – when React runs your rendering code again, your side effects will be triggered in a way that won’t match what you want. This often leads to unexpected bugs that can degrade how your users experience your app. You can see an example of this in the Keeping Components Pure page . How does React run your code?

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\". How does React run your code? React is declarative: you tell React what to render, and React will figure out how best to display it to your user. To do this, React has a few phases where it runs your code. You don’t need to know about all of these phases to use React well. But at a high level, you should know about what code runs in render , and what runs outside of it. Rendering refers to calculating what the next version of your UI should look like. After rendering, Effects are flushed (meaning they are run until there are no more left) and may update the calculation if the Effects have impacts on layout. React takes this new calculation and compares it to the calculation used to create the previous version of your UI, then commits just the minimum changes needed to the DOM (what your user actually sees) to catch it up to the latest version. Deep Dive How to tell if code runs in render Show Details One quick heuristic to tell if code runs during render is to examine where it is: if it’s written at the top level like in the example below, there’s a good chance it runs during render. <code_snipet> function Dropdown() { const selectedItems = new Set(); // created during render // ...} </code_snipet> Event handlers and Effects don’t run in render: <code_snipet> function Dropdown() { const selectedItems = new Set(); const onSelect = (item) => { // this code is in an event handler, so it's only run when the user triggers this selectedItems.add(item); }} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> function Dropdown() { const selectedItems = new Set(); useEffect(() => { // this code is inside of an Effect, so it only runs after rendering logForAnalytics(selectedItems); }, [selectedItems]);} </code_snipet> Components and Hooks must be idempotent Components must always return the same output with respect to their inputs – props, state, and context.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"with respect to their inputs – props, state, and context. This is known as idempotency . Idempotency is a term popularized in functional programming. It refers to the idea that you always get the same result every time you run that piece of code with the same inputs. This means that all code that runs during render must also be idempotent in order for this rule to hold. For example, this line of code is not idempotent (and therefore, neither is the component): <code_snipet> function Clock() { const time = new Date(); // 🔴 Bad: always returns a different result! return <span>{time.toLocaleString()}</span>} </code_snipet> new Date() is not idempotent as it always returns the current date and changes its result every time it’s called. When you render the above component, the time displayed on the screen will stay stuck on the time that the component was rendered. Similarly, functions like Math.random() also aren’t idempotent, because they return different results every time they’re called, even when the inputs are the same. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use non-idempotent functions like new Date() at all – you should just avoid using them during render . In this case, we can synchronize the latest date to this component using an Effect : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; function useTime() { // 1. Keep track of the current date's state. `useState` receives an initializer function as its // initial state. It only runs once when the hook is called, so only the current date at the // time the hook is called is set first. const [time, setTime] = useState(() => new Date()); useEffect(() => { // 2. Update the current date every second using `setInterval`. const id = setInterval(() => { setTime(new Date()); // ✅ Good: non-idempotent code no longer runs in render }, 1000); // 3. Return a cleanup function so we don't leak the `setInterval` timer. return () => clearInterval(id); }, []); return time; } export default function Clock() { const\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"runs in render }, 1000); // 3. Return a cleanup function so we don't leak the `setInterval` timer. return () => clearInterval(id); }, []); return time; } export default function Clock() { const time = useTime(); return <span>{time.toLocaleString()}</span>; } Show more By wrapping the non-idempotent new Date() call in an Effect, it moves that calculation outside of rendering . If you don’t need to synchronize some external state with React, you can also consider using an event handler if it only needs to be updated in response to a user interaction. Side effects must run outside of render Side effects should not run in render , as React can render components multiple times to create the best possible user experience. Note Side effects are a broader term than Effects. Effects specifically refer to code that’s wrapped in useEffect , while a side effect is a general term for code that has any observable effect other than its primary result of returning a value to the caller. Side effects are typically written inside of event handlers or Effects. But never during render. While render must be kept pure, side effects are necessary at some point in order for your app to do anything interesting, like showing something on the screen! The key point of this rule is that side effects should not run in render , as React can render components multiple times. In most cases, you’ll use event handlers to handle side effects. Using an event handler explicitly tells React that this code doesn’t need to run during render, keeping render pure. If you’ve exhausted all options – and only as a last resort – you can also handle side effects using useEffect . When is it okay to have mutation? Local mutation One common example of a side effect is mutation, which in JavaScript refers to changing the value of a non- primitive value. In general, while mutation is not idiomatic in React, local mutation is absolutely fine: <code_snipet> function FriendList({ friends }) { const items = []; // ✅\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"the value of a non- primitive value. In general, while mutation is not idiomatic in React, local mutation is absolutely fine: <code_snipet> function FriendList({ friends }) { const items = []; // ✅ Good: locally created for (let i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) { const friend = friends[i]; items.push( <Friend key={friend.id} friend={friend} /> ); // ✅ Good: local mutation is okay } return <section>{items}</section>;} </code_snipet> There is no need to contort your code to avoid local mutation. Array.map could also be used here for brevity, but there is nothing wrong with creating a local array and then pushing items into it during render . Even though it looks like we are mutating items , the key point to note is that this code only does so locally – the mutation isn’t “remembered” when the component is rendered again. In other words, items only stays around as long as the component does. Because items is always recreated every time <FriendList /> is rendered, the component will always return the same result. On the other hand, if items was created outside of the component, it holds on to its previous values and remembers changes: <code_snipet> const items = []; // 🔴 Bad: created outside of the componentfunction FriendList({ friends }) { for (let i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) { const friend = friends[i]; items.push( <Friend key={friend.id} friend={friend} /> ); // 🔴 Bad: mutates a value created outside of render } return <section>{items}</section>;} </code_snipet> When <FriendList /> runs again, we will continue appending friends to items every time that component is run, leading to multiple duplicated results. This version of <FriendList /> has observable side effects during render and breaks the rule . Lazy initialization Lazy initialization is also fine despite not being fully “pure”: <code_snipet> function ExpenseForm() { SuperCalculator.initializeIfNotReady(); // ✅ Good: if it doesn't affect other components // Continue rendering...} </code_snipet> Changing\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"being fully “pure”: <code_snipet> function ExpenseForm() { SuperCalculator.initializeIfNotReady(); // ✅ Good: if it doesn't affect other components // Continue rendering...} </code_snipet> Changing the DOM Side effects that are directly visible to the user are not allowed in the render logic of React components. In other words, merely calling a component function shouldn’t by itself produce a change on the screen. <code_snipet> function ProductDetailPage({ product }) { document.title = product.title; // 🔴 Bad: Changes the DOM} </code_snipet> One way to achieve the desired result of updating document.title outside of render is to synchronize the component with document . As long as calling a component multiple times is safe and doesn’t affect the rendering of other components, React doesn’t care if it’s 100% pure in the strict functional programming sense of the word. It is more important that components must be idempotent . Props and state are immutable A component’s props and state are immutable snapshots . Never mutate them directly. Instead, pass new props down, and use the setter function from useState . You can think of the props and state values as snapshots that are updated after rendering. For this reason, you don’t modify the props or state variables directly: instead you pass new props, or use the setter function provided to you to tell React that state needs to update the next time the component is rendered. Don’t mutate Props Props are immutable because if you mutate them, the application will produce inconsistent output, which can be hard to debug since it may or may not work depending on the circumstance. <code_snipet> function Post({ item }) { item.url = new Url(item.url, base); // 🔴 Bad: never mutate props directly return <Link url={item.url}>{item.title}</Link>;} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> function Post({ item }) { const url = new Url(item.url, base); // ✅ Good: make a copy instead return <Link url={url}>{item.title}</Link>;} </code_snipet> Don’t\"),\n",

Changing values on the state variable doesn’t cause the component to update, leaving your users with an outdated UI. Using the setter function informs React that the state has changed, and that we need to queue a re-render to update the UI. <code_snipet> function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { count = count + 1; // 🔴 Bad: never mutate state directly } return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> You pressed me {count} times </button> );} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); // ✅ Good: use the setter function returned by useState } return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> You pressed me {count} times </button> );} </code_snipet> Return values and arguments to Hooks are immutable Once values are passed to a hook, you should not modify them. Like props in JSX, values become immutable when passed to a hook. <code_snipet> function useIconStyle(icon) { const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); if (icon.enabled) { icon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); // 🔴 Bad: never mutate hook arguments directly } return icon;} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> function useIconStyle(icon) { const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); const newIcon = { ...icon }; // ✅ Good: make a copy instead if (icon.enabled) { newIcon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); } return newIcon;} </code_snipet> One important principle in React is local reasoning : the ability to understand what a component or'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='(icon.enabled) { newIcon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); } return newIcon;} </code_snipet> One important principle in React is local reasoning : the ability to understand what a component or hook does by looking at its code in isolation. Hooks should be treated like “black boxes” when they are called. For example, a custom hook might have used its arguments as dependencies to memoize values inside it: <code_snipet> function useIconStyle(icon) { const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); return useMemo(() => { const newIcon = { ...icon }; if (icon.enabled) { newIcon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); } return newIcon; }, [icon, theme]);} </code_snipet> If you were to mutate the Hooks arguments, the custom hook’s memoization will become incorrect, so it’s important to avoid doing that. <code_snipet> style = useIconStyle(icon); // `style` is memoized based on `icon`icon.enabled = false; // Bad: 🔴 never mutate hook arguments directlystyle = useIconStyle(icon); // previously memoized result is returned </code_snipet> <code_snipet> style = useIconStyle(icon); // `style` is memoized based on `icon`icon = { ...icon, enabled: false }; // Good: ✅ make a copy insteadstyle = useIconStyle(icon); // new value of `style` is calculated </code_snipet> Similarly, it’s important to not modify the return values of Hooks, as they may have been memoized. Values are immutable after being passed to JSX Don’t mutate values after they’ve been used in JSX. Move the mutation before the JSX is created. When you use JSX in an expression, React may eagerly evaluate the JSX before the component finishes rendering. This means that mutating values after they’ve been passed to JSX can lead to outdated UIs, as React won’t know to update the component’s output. <code_snipet> function Page({ colour }) { const styles = { colour, size: \"large\" }; const header = <Header styles={styles} />; styles.size = \"small\"; // 🔴 Bad: styles was already used in the JSX above const footer = <Footer'),\n",

Letting React orchestrate rendering also allows a number of benefits: Components become more than functions. React can augment them with features like local state through Hooks that are tied to the component’s identity in the tree. Component types participate in reconciliation. By letting React call your components, you also tell it more about the conceptual structure of your tree. For example, when you move from rendering <Feed> to the <Profile> page, React won’t attempt to re-use them. React can enhance your user experience. For example, it can let the browser do some work between component calls so that re-rendering a large component tree doesn’t block the main thread. A better debugging story. If components are first-class citizens that the library is aware of, we can build rich developer tools for introspection in development. More efficient reconciliation. React can decide exactly which components in the tree need re-rendering and skip over the ones that don’t. That makes your app faster and more snappy. Never pass around Hooks as regular values Hooks should only be called inside of components or Hooks. Never pass it around as a regular value. Hooks allow you to augment a component with React features. They should always be called as a function, and never passed around as a regular value. This enables'),\n",

This enables local reasoning , or the ability for developers to understand everything a component can do by looking at that component in isolation. Breaking this rule will cause React to not automatically optimize your component. Don’t dynamically mutate a Hook Hooks should be as “static” as possible. This means you shouldn’t dynamically mutate them. For example, this means you shouldn’t write higher order Hooks: <code_snipet> function ChatInput() { const useDataWithLogging = withLogging(useData); // 🔴 Bad: don't write higher order Hooks const data = useDataWithLogging();} </code_snipet> Hooks should be immutable and not be mutated.

It also makes it easier to accidentally break the Rules of Hooks that Hooks should not be called conditionally.

While React Server Components in React 19 are stable and will not break between minor versions, the underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. To support React Server Components as a bundler or framework, we recommend pinning to a specific React version, or using the Canary release. We will continue working with bundlers and frameworks to stabilize the APIs used to implement React Server Components in the future. Server Components without a Server Server components can run at build time to read from the filesystem or fetch static content, so a web server is not required. For example, you may want to read static data from a content management system. Without Server Components, it’s common to fetch static data on the client with an Effect: <code_snipet> // bundle.jsimport marked from 'marked'; // 35.9K (11.2K gzipped)import sanitizeHtml from 'sanitize-html'; // 206K (63.3K gzipped)function Page({page}) { const [content, setContent] = useState(''); // NOTE: loads *after* first page render. useEffect(() => { fetch(`/api/content/${page}`).then((data) => { setContent(data.content); }); }, [page]); return <div>{sanitizeHtml(marked(content))}</div>;} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> // api.jsapp.get(`/api/content/:page`, async (req, res) => { const page = req.params.page; const content = await file.readFile(`${page}.md`); res.send({content});}); </code_snipet> This pattern means users need to download and parse an additional 75K (gzipped) of libraries, and wait for a second request to fetch the data after the page loads, just to render static content that will not change for the lifetime of the page.

This new application architecture combines the simple “request/response” mental model of server-centric Multi-Page Apps with the seamless interactivity of client-centric Single-Page Apps, giving you the best of both worlds. Adding interactivity to Server Components Server Components are not sent to the browser, so they cannot use interactive APIs like useState . To add interactivity to Server Components, you can compose them with Client Component using the \"use client\" directive. Note There is no directive for Server Components. A common misunderstanding is that Server Components are denoted by \"use server\" , but there is no directive for Server Components. The \"use server\" directive is used for Server Functions. For more info, see the docs for Directives . In the following example, the Notes Server Component imports an Expandable Client Component that uses state to toggle its expanded state: <code_snipet> // Server Componentimport Expandable from \\'./Expandable\\';async function Notes() { const notes = await db.notes.getAll(); return ( <div> {notes.map(note => ( <Expandable key={note.id}> <p note={note} /> </Expandable> ))} </div> )} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> // Client Component\"use client\"export default function Expandable({children}) { const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false); return ( <div> <button onClick={() => setExpanded(!expanded)} > Toggle </button> {expanded && children} </div> )} </code_snipet> This works by first rendering Notes as a Server Component, and then instructing the bundler to create a bundle for the Client Component Expandable . In the browser, the Client Components will see output of the Server Components passed as props: <code_snipet> <head> <!-- the bundle for Client Components --> <script src=\"bundle.js\" /></head><body> <div> <Expandable key={1}> <p>this is the first note</p> </Expandable> <Expandable key={2}> <p>this is the second note</p> </Expandable> <!--...--> </div> </body> </code_snipet> Async'),\n",

When you await in an async component, React will suspend and wait for the promise to resolve before resuming rendering. This works across server/client boundaries with streaming support for Suspense. You can even create a promise on the server, and await it on the client: <code_snipet> // Server Componentimport db from \\'./database\\';async function Page({id}) { // Will suspend the Server Component. const note = await db.notes.get(id); // NOTE: not awaited, will start here and await on the client. const commentsPromise = db.comments.get(note.id); return ( <div> {note} <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading Comments...</p>}> <Comments commentsPromise={commentsPromise} /> </Suspense> </div> );} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> // Client Component\"use client\";import {use} from \\'react\\';function Comments({commentsPromise}) { // NOTE: this will resume the promise from the server. // It will suspend until the data is available. const comments = use(commentsPromise); return comments.map(commment => <p>{comment}</p>);} </code_snipet> The note content is important data for the page to render, so we await it on the server. The comments are below the fold and lower-priority, so we start the promise on the server, and wait for it on the client with the use API. This will Suspend on the client, without blocking the note content from rendering. Since async components are not supported on the client , we await the promise with use .

While Server Functions in React 19 are stable and will not break between minor versions, the underlying APIs used to implement Server Functions in a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. To support Server Functions as a bundler or framework, we recommend pinning to a specific React version, or using the Canary release. We will continue working with bundlers and frameworks to stabilize the APIs used to implement Server Functions in the future. When a Server Functions is defined with the \"use server\" directive, your framework will automatically create a reference to the server function, and pass that reference to the Client Component. When that function is called on the client, React will send a request to the server to execute the function, and return the result. Server Functions can be created in Server Components and passed as props to Client Components, or they can be imported and used in Client Components. Usage Creating a Server Function from a Server Component Server Components can define Server Functions with the \"use server\" directive: <code_snipet> // Server Componentimport Button from \\'./Button\\';function EmptyNote () { async function createNoteAction() { // Server Function \\'use server\\'; await db.notes.create(); } return <Button onClick={createNoteAction}/>;} </code_snipet> When React renders the EmptyNote Server Function, it will create a reference to the createNoteAction function, and pass that reference to the Button Client Component. When the button is clicked, React will send a request to the server to execute the createNoteAction function with the reference provided: <code_snipet> \"use client\";export default function Button({onClick}) { console.log(onClick); // {$$typeof:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='request to the server to execute the createNoteAction function with the reference provided: <code_snipet> \"use client\";export default function Button({onClick}) { console.log(onClick); // {$$typeof: Symbol.for(\"react.server.reference\"), $$id: \\'createNoteAction\\'} return <button onClick={() => onClick()}>Create Empty Note</button>} </code_snipet> For more, see the docs for \"use server\" . Importing Server Functions from Client Components Client Components can import Server Functions from files that use the \"use server\" directive: <code_snipet> \"use server\";export async function createNote() { await db.notes.create();} </code_snipet> When the bundler builds the EmptyNote Client Component, it will create a reference to the createNoteAction function in the bundle. When the button is clicked, React will send a request to the server to execute the createNoteAction function using the reference provided: <code_snipet> \"use client\";import {createNote} from \\'./actions\\';function EmptyNote() { console.log(createNote); // {$$typeof: Symbol.for(\"react.server.reference\"), $$id: \\'createNoteAction\\'} <button onClick={() => createNote()} />} </code_snipet> For more, see the docs for \"use server\" . Server Functions with Actions Server Functions can be called from Actions on the client: <code_snipet> \"use server\";export async function updateName(name) { if (!name) { return {error: \\'Name is required\\'}; } await db.users.updateName(name);} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> \"use client\";import {updateName} from \\'./actions\\';function UpdateName() { const [name, setName] = useState(\\'\\'); const [error, setError] = useState(null); const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); const submitAction = async () => { startTransition(async () => { const {error} = await updateName(name); if (!error) { setError(error); } else { setName(\\'\\'); } }) } return ( <form action={submitAction}> <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" disabled={isPending}/> {state.error && <span>Failed: {state.error}</span>} </form> )}'),\n",

For more, see the docs for Calling a Server Function outside of <form> Server Functions with Form Actions Server Functions work with the new Form features in React 19. You can pass a Server Function to a Form to automatically submit the form to the server: <code_snipet> \"use client\";import {updateName} from \\'./actions\\';function UpdateName() { return ( <form action={updateName}> <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" /> </form> )} </code_snipet> When the Form submission succeeds, React will automatically reset the form. You can add useActionState to access the pending state, last response, or to support progressive enhancement. For more, see the docs for Server Functions in Forms . Server Functions with useActionState You can call Server Functions with useActionState for the common case where you just need access to the action pending state and last returned response: <code_snipet> \"use client\";import {updateName} from \\'./actions\\';function UpdateName() { const [state, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(updateName, {error: null}); return ( <form action={submitAction}> <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" disabled={isPending}/> {state.error && <span>Failed: {state.error}</span>} </form> );} </code_snipet> When using useActionState with Server Functions, React will also automatically replay form submissions entered before hydration finishes. This means users can interact with your app even before the app has hydrated. For more, see the docs for useActionState . Progressive enhancement with useActionState Server Functions also support progressive enhancement with the third argument of useActionState . <code_snipet> \"use client\";import {updateName} from'),\n",

Note that a single module may be evaluated on the server when imported from server code and on the client when imported from client code.

Any other use case will throw an exception. How \\'use client\\' marks client code In a React app, components are often split into separate files, or modules . For apps that use React Server Components, the app is server-rendered by default. \\'use client\\' introduces a server-client boundary in the module dependency tree , effectively creating a subtree of Client modules. To better illustrate this, consider the following React Server Components app. App.js FancyText.js InspirationGenerator.js Copyright.js inspirations.js App.js Reset Fork import FancyText from \\'./FancyText\\'; import InspirationGenerator from \\'./InspirationGenerator\\'; import Copyright from \\'./Copyright\\'; export default function App() { return ( <> <FancyText title text=\"Get Inspired App\" /> <InspirationGenerator> <Copyright year={2004} /> </InspirationGenerator> </> ); } In the module dependency tree of this example app, the \\'use client\\' directive in InspirationGenerator.js marks that module and all of its transitive dependencies as Client modules. The subtree starting at InspirationGenerator.js is now marked as Client modules. \\'use client\\' segments the module dependency tree of the React Server Components app, marking InspirationGenerator.js and all of its dependencies as client-rendered. During render, the framework will server-render the root component and continue through the render tree , opting-out of evaluating any code imported from client-marked code. The server-rendered portion of the render tree is then sent to the client. The client, with its client code downloaded, then completes rendering the rest of the tree.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"tree. The render tree for the React Server Components app. InspirationGenerator and its child component FancyText are components exported from client-marked code and considered Client Components. We introduce the following definitions: Client Components are components in a render tree that are rendered on the client. Server Components are components in a render tree that are rendered on the server. Working through the example app, App , FancyText and Copyright are all server-rendered and considered Server Components. As InspirationGenerator.js and its transitive dependencies are marked as client code, the component InspirationGenerator and its child component FancyText are Client Components. Deep Dive How is FancyText both a Server and a Client Component? Show Details By the above definitions, the component FancyText is both a Server and Client Component, how can that be? First, let’s clarify that the term “component” is not very precise. Here are just two ways “component” can be understood: A “component” can refer to a component definition . In most cases this will be a function. <code_snipet> // This is a definition of a componentfunction MyComponent() { return <p>My Component</p>} </code_snipet> A “component” can also refer to a component usage of its definition. <code_snipet> import MyComponent from './MyComponent';function App() { // This is a usage of a component return <MyComponent />;} </code_snipet> Often, the imprecision is not important when explaining concepts, but in this case it is. When we talk about Server or Client Components, we are referring to component usages. If the component is defined in a module with a 'use client' directive, or the component is imported and called in a Client Component, then the component usage is a Client Component. Otherwise, the component usage is a Server Component. A render tree illustrates component usages.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"the component usage is a Server Component. A render tree illustrates component usages. Back to the question of FancyText , we see that the component definition does not have a 'use client' directive and it has two usages. The usage of FancyText as a child of App , marks that usage as a Server Component. When FancyText is imported and called under InspirationGenerator , that usage of FancyText is a Client Component as InspirationGenerator contains a 'use client' directive. This means that the component definition for FancyText will both be evaluated on the server and also downloaded by the client to render its Client Component usage. Deep Dive Why is Copyright a Server Component? Show Details Because Copyright is rendered as a child of the Client Component InspirationGenerator , you might be surprised that it is a Server Component. Recall that 'use client' defines the boundary between server and client code on the module dependency tree , not the render tree. 'use client' defines the boundary between server and client code on the module dependency tree. In the module dependency tree, we see that App.js imports and calls Copyright from the Copyright.js module. As Copyright.js does not contain a 'use client' directive, the component usage is rendered on the server. App is rendered on the server as it is the root component. Client Components can render Server Components because you can pass JSX as props. In this case, InspirationGenerator receives Copyright as children . However, the InspirationGenerator module never directly imports the Copyright module nor calls the component, all of that is done by App . In fact, the Copyright component is fully executed before InspirationGenerator starts rendering. The takeaway is that a parent-child render relationship between components does not guarantee the same render environment. When to use 'use client' With 'use client' , you can determine when components are Client Components. As Server Components are default, here is a\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"does not guarantee the same render environment. When to use 'use client' With 'use client' , you can determine when components are Client Components. As Server Components are default, here is a brief overview of the advantages and limitations to Server Components to determine when you need to mark something as client rendered. For simplicity, we talk about Server Components, but the same principles apply to all code in your app that is server run. Advantages of Server Components Server Components can reduce the amount of code sent and run by the client. Only Client modules are bundled and evaluated by the client. Server Components benefit from running on the server. They can access the local filesystem and may experience low latency for data fetches and network requests. Limitations of Server Components Server Components cannot support interaction as event handlers must be registered and triggered by a client. For example, event handlers like onClick can only be defined in Client Components. Server Components cannot use most Hooks. When Server Components are rendered, their output is essentially a list of components for the client to render. Server Components do not persist in memory after render and cannot have their own state. Serializable types returned by Server Components As in any React app, parent components pass data to child components. As they are rendered in different environments, passing data from a Server Component to a Client Component requires extra consideration. Prop values passed from a Server Component to Client Component must be serializable. Serializable props include: Primitives string number bigint boolean undefined null symbol , only symbols registered in the global Symbol registry via Symbol.for Iterables containing serializable values String Array Map Set TypedArray and ArrayBuffer Date Plain objects : those created with object initializers , with serializable properties Functions that are Server Functions Client or Server Component\"),\n",

Symbol('my new symbol') Usage Building with interactivity and state App.js App.js Reset Fork 'use client'; import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Counter({initialValue = 0}) { const [countValue, setCountValue] = useState(initialValue); const increment = () => setCountValue(countValue + 1); const decrement = () => setCountValue(countValue - 1); return ( <> <h2>Count Value: {countValue}</h2> <button onClick={increment}>+1</button> <button onClick={decrement}>-1</button> </> ); } Show more As Counter requires both the useState Hook and event handlers to increment or decrement the value, this component must be a Client Component and will require a 'use client' directive at the top. In contrast, a component that renders UI without interaction will not need to be a Client Component. <code_snipet> import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';import Counter from './Counter';export default async function CounterContainer() { const initialValue = await readFile('/path/to/counter_value'); return <Counter initialValue={initialValue} />} </code_snipet> For example, Counter ’s parent component, CounterContainer , does not require 'use client' as it is not interactive and does not use state. In addition, CounterContainer must be a Server Component as it reads from the local file system on the server, which is possible only in a Server Component.

In our earlier example, FancyText is one such component. <code_snipet> export default function FancyText({title, text}) { return title ? <h1 className='fancy title'>{text}</h1> : <h3 className='fancy cursive'>{text}</h3>} </code_snipet> In this case, we don’t add the 'use client' directive, resulting in FancyText ’s output (rather than its source code) to be sent to the browser when referenced from a Server Component. As demonstrated in the earlier Inspirations app example, FancyText is used as both a Server or Client Component, depending on where it is imported and used. But if FancyText ’s HTML output was large relative to its source code (including dependencies), it might be more efficient to force it to always be a Client Component. Components that return a long SVG path string are one case where it may be more efficient to force a component to be a Client Component. Using client APIs Your React app may use client-specific APIs, such as the browser’s APIs for web storage, audio and video manipulation, and device hardware, among others . In this example, the component uses DOM APIs to manipulate a canvas element. Since those APIs are only available in the browser, it must be marked as a Client Component. <code_snipet> 'use client';import {useRef, useEffect} from 'react';export default function Circle() { const ref = useRef(null); useLayoutEffect(() => { const canvas = ref.current; const context = canvas.getContext('2d'); context.reset(); context.beginPath(); context.arc(100, 75, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI); context.stroke(); }); return <canvas ref={ref} />;} </code_snipet> Using third-party libraries Often in a React app, you’ll leverage third-party libraries to handle common UI patterns or logic.

Under Construction To prevent sending sensitive data from a Server Function, there are experimental taint APIs to prevent unique values and objects from being passed to client code. See experimental_taintUniqueValue and experimental_taintObjectReference . Serializable arguments and return values Since client code calls the Server Function over the network, any arguments passed will need to be serializable.

When a user submits this form, there is a network request to the server function requestUsername . When calling a Server Function in a form, React will supply the form’s FormData as the first argument to the Server Function. By passing a Server Function to the form action , React can progressively enhance the form. This means that forms can be submitted before the JavaScript bundle is loaded. Handling return values in forms In the username request form, there might be the chance that a username is not available. requestUsername should tell us if it fails or not. To update the UI based on the result of a Server Function while supporting progressive enhancement, use useActionState . <code_snipet> // requestUsername.js\\'use server\\';export default async function requestUsername(formData) { const username = formData.get(\\'username\\'); if (canRequest(username)) { // ... return \\'successful\\'; } return \\'failed\\';} </code_snipet> <code_snipet> // UsernameForm.js\\'use client\\';import { useActionState } from \\'react\\';import requestUsername from \\'./requestUsername\\';function UsernameForm() { const [state, action] = useActionState(requestUsername, null, \\'n/a\\'); return ( <> <form action={action}> <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" /> <button type=\"submit\">Request</button> </form> <p>Last submission request returned: {state}</p> </> );} </code_snipet> Note that like most Hooks, useActionState can only be'),\n",

Usage Transforming children To transform the children JSX that your component receives as the children prop, call Children.map : <code_snipet> import { Children } from \\'react\\';function RowList({ children }) { return ( <div className=\"RowList\"> {Children.map(children, child => <div className=\"Row\"> {child} </div> )} </div> );} </code_snipet> In the example above, the RowList wraps every child it receives into a <div className=\"Row\"> container. For example, let’s say the parent component passes three <p> tags as the children prop to RowList : <code_snipet> <RowList> <p>This is the first item.</p> <p>This is the second item.</p> <p>This is the third item.</p></RowList> </code_snipet> Then, with the RowList implementation above, the final rendered result will look like this: <code_snipet> <div className=\"RowList\"> <div className=\"Row\"> <p>This is the first item.</p> </div> <div className=\"Row\"> <p>This is the second item.</p> </div> <div className=\"Row\"> <p>This is the third item.</p> </div></div> </code_snipet> Children.map is similar to to transforming arrays with map() . The difference is that the children data structure is considered opaque. This means that even if it’s sometimes an array, you should not assume it’s an array or any other particular data type. This is why you should use Children.map if you need to transform it. App.js RowList.js RowList.js Reset Fork import { Children } from \\'react\\'; export default function RowList({ children }) { return ( <div className=\"RowList\"> {Children.map(children, child => <div className=\"Row\"> {child} </div> )} </div> ); } Deep Dive Why is the children prop not always an array?

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Deep Dive Why is the children prop not always an array? Show Details In React, the children prop is considered an opaque data structure. This means that you shouldn’t rely on how it is structured. To transform, filter, or count children, you should use the Children methods. In practice, the children data structure is often represented as an array internally. However, if there is only a single child, then React won’t create an extra array since this would lead to unnecessary memory overhead. As long as you use the Children methods instead of directly introspecting the children prop, your code will not break even if React changes how the data structure is actually implemented. Even when children is an array, Children.map has useful special behavior. For example, Children.map combines the keys on the returned elements with the keys on the children you’ve passed to it. This ensures the original JSX children don’t “lose” keys even if they get wrapped like in the example above. Pitfall The children data structure does not include rendered output of the components you pass as JSX. In the example below, the children received by the RowList only contains two items rather than three: <p>This is the first item.</p> <MoreRows /> This is why only two row wrappers are generated in this example: App.js RowList.js App.js Reset Fork import RowList from './RowList.js'; export default function App() { return ( <RowList> <p>This is the first item.</p> <MoreRows /> </RowList> ); } function MoreRows() { return ( <> <p>This is the second item.</p> <p>This is the third item.</p> </> ); } Show more There is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component like <MoreRows /> when manipulating children .

Alternatives Note This section describes alternatives to the Children API (with capital C ) that’s imported like this: <code_snipet> import { Children } from \\'react\\'; </code_snipet> Don’t confuse it with using the children prop (lowercase c ), which is good and encouraged. Exposing multiple components Manipulating children with the Children methods often leads to fragile code. When you pass children to a component in JSX, you don’t usually expect the component to manipulate or transform the individual children. When you can, try to avoid using the Children methods. For example, if you want every child of RowList to be wrapped in <div className=\"Row\"> , export a Row component, and manually wrap every row into it like this: App.js RowList.js App.js Reset Fork import { RowList, Row } from \\'./RowList.js\\'; export default function App() { return ( <RowList> <Row> <p>This is the first item.</p> </Row> <Row> <p>This is the second item.</p> </Row> <Row> <p>This is the third item.</p> </Row> </RowList> ); } Show more Unlike using Children.map , this approach does not wrap every child automatically. However, this approach has a significant benefit compared to the earlier example with Children.map because it works even if you keep extracting more components. For example, it still works if you extract your own MoreRows component: App.js RowList.js App.js Reset Fork import { RowList, Row } from \\'./RowList.js\\'; export default function App() { return ( <RowList> <Row> <p>This is the first item.</p> </Row> <MoreRows /> </RowList> ); } function MoreRows() { return ( <> <Row> <p>This is the second item.</p> </Row> <Row> <p>This is the third item.</p> </Row> </> ); } Show more This wouldn’t work with Children.map because it would “see” <MoreRows /> as a single child (and a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"<p>This is the second item.</p> </Row> <Row> <p>This is the third item.</p> </Row> </> ); } Show more This wouldn’t work with Children.map because it would “see” <MoreRows /> as a single child (and a single row). Accepting an array of objects as a prop You can also explicitly pass an array as a prop. For example, this RowList accepts a rows array as a prop: App.js RowList.js App.js Reset Fork import { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js'; export default function App() { return ( <RowList rows={[ { id: 'first', content: <p>This is the first item.</p> }, { id: 'second', content: <p>This is the second item.</p> }, { id: 'third', content: <p>This is the third item.</p> } ]} /> ); } Since rows is a regular JavaScript array, the RowList component can use built-in array methods like map on it. This pattern is especially useful when you want to be able to pass more information as structured data together with children. In the below example, the TabSwitcher component receives an array of objects as the tabs prop: App.js TabSwitcher.js App.js Reset Fork import TabSwitcher from './TabSwitcher.js'; export default function App() { return ( <TabSwitcher tabs={[ { id: 'first', header: 'First', content: <p>This is the first item.</p> }, { id: 'second', header: 'Second', content: <p>This is the second item.</p> }, { id: 'third', header: 'Third', content: <p>This is the third item.</p> } ]} /> ); } Show more Unlike passing the children as JSX, this approach lets you associate some extra data like header with each item. Because you are working with the tabs directly, and it is an array, you do not need the Children methods. Calling a render prop to customize rendering Instead of producing JSX for every single item, you can also pass a function that returns JSX, and call that function when necessary. In this example, the App component passes a renderContent function to the TabSwitcher component. The TabSwitcher component calls renderContent only for the selected tab: App.js\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"when necessary. In this example, the App component passes a renderContent function to the TabSwitcher component. The TabSwitcher component calls renderContent only for the selected tab: App.js TabSwitcher.js App.js Reset Fork import TabSwitcher from './TabSwitcher.js'; export default function App() { return ( <TabSwitcher tabIds={['first', 'second', 'third']} getHeader={tabId => { return tabId[0].toUpperCase() + tabId.slice(1); }} renderContent={tabId => { return <p>This is the {tabId} item.</p>; }} /> ); } A prop like renderContent is called a render prop because it is a prop that specifies how to render a piece of the user interface. However, there is nothing special about it: it is a regular prop which happens to be a function. Render props are functions, so you can pass information to them. For example, this RowList component passes the id and the index of each row to the renderRow render prop, which uses index to highlight even rows: App.js RowList.js App.js Reset Fork import { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js'; export default function App() { return ( <RowList rowIds={['first', 'second', 'third']} renderRow={(id, index) => { return ( <Row isHighlighted={index % 2 === 0}> <p>This is the {id} item.</p> </Row> ); }} /> ); } Show more This is another example of how parent and child components can cooperate without manipulating the children. Troubleshooting I pass a custom component, but the Children methods don’t show its render result Suppose you pass two children to RowList like this: <code_snipet> <RowList> <p>First item</p> <MoreRows /></RowList> </code_snipet> If you do Children.count(children) inside RowList , you will get 2 . Even if MoreRows renders 10 different items, or if it returns null , Children.count(children) will still be 2 . From the RowList ’s perspective, it only “sees” the JSX it has received. It does not “see” the internals of the MoreRows component. The limitation makes it hard to extract a component. This is why alternatives are preferred\"),\n",

Parameters element : The element argument must be a valid React element. For example, it could be a JSX node like <Something /> , the result of calling createElement , or the result of another cloneElement call. props : The props argument must either be an object or null . If you pass null , the cloned element will retain all of the original element.props . Otherwise, for every prop in the props object, the returned element will “prefer” the value from props over the value from element.props .

Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it. Caveats Cloning an element does not modify the original element. You should only pass children as multiple arguments to cloneElement if they are all statically known, like cloneElement(element, null, child1, child2, child3) . If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: cloneElement(element, null, listItems) . This ensures that React will warn you about missing key s for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder. cloneElement makes it harder to trace the data flow, so try the alternatives instead. Usage Overriding props of an element To override the props of some React element , pass it to cloneElement with the props you want to override : <code_snipet> import { cloneElement } from \\'react\\';// ...const clonedElement = cloneElement( <Row title=\"Cabbage\" />, { isHighlighted: true }); </code_snipet> Here, the resulting cloned element will be <Row title=\"Cabbage\" isHighlighted={true} /> . Let’s walk through an example to see when it’s useful. Imagine a List component that renders its children as a list of selectable rows with a “Next” button that changes which row is selected. The List component needs to render the selected Row differently, so it clones every <Row> child that it has received, and adds an extra isHighlighted: true or isHighlighted: false prop: <code_snipet> export default function List({ children }) { const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0); return ( <div className=\"List\"> {Children.map(children, (child, index) => cloneElement(child, { isHighlighted: index === selectedIndex }) )} </code_snipet> Let’s say the original JSX received by List looks like this: <code_snipet> <List> <Row title=\"Cabbage\" /> <Row'),\n",

The result looks like this: <code_snipet> <List> <Row title=\"Cabbage\" isHighlighted={true} /> <Row title=\"Garlic\" isHighlighted={false} /> <Row title=\"Apple\" isHighlighted={false} /></List> </code_snipet> Notice how pressing “Next” updates the state of the List , and highlights a different row: App.js List.js Row.js data.js List.js Reset Fork import { Children, cloneElement, useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function List({ children }) { const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0); return ( <div className=\"List\"> {Children.map(children, (child, index) => cloneElement(child, { isHighlighted: index === selectedIndex }) )} <hr /> <button onClick={() => { setSelectedIndex(i => (i + 1) % Children.count(children) ); }}> Next </button> </div> ); } Show more To summarize, the List cloned the <Row /> elements it received and added an extra prop to them.

List calls renderItem for every item and passes isHighlighted as an argument: <code_snipet> export default function List({ items, renderItem }) { const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0); return ( <div className=\"List\"> {items.map((item, index) => { const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex; return renderItem(item, isHighlighted); })} </code_snipet> The renderItem prop is called a “render prop” because it’s a prop that specifies how to render something. For example, you can pass a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='return renderItem(item, isHighlighted); })} </code_snipet> The renderItem prop is called a “render prop” because it’s a prop that specifies how to render something. For example, you can pass a renderItem implementation that renders a <Row> with the given isHighlighted value: <code_snipet> <List items={products} renderItem={(product, isHighlighted) => <Row key={product.id} title={product.title} isHighlighted={isHighlighted} /> }/> </code_snipet> The end result is the same as with cloneElement : <code_snipet> <List> <Row title=\"Cabbage\" isHighlighted={true} /> <Row title=\"Garlic\" isHighlighted={false} /> <Row title=\"Apple\" isHighlighted={false} /></List> </code_snipet> However, you can clearly trace where the isHighlighted value is coming from. App.js List.js Row.js data.js List.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function List({ items, renderItem }) { const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0); return ( <div className=\"List\"> {items.map((item, index) => { const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex; return renderItem(item, isHighlighted); })} <hr /> <button onClick={() => { setSelectedIndex(i => (i + 1) % items.length ); }}> Next </button> </div> ); } Show more This pattern is preferred to cloneElement because it is more explicit. Passing data through context Another alternative to cloneElement is to pass data through context. For example, you can call createContext to define a HighlightContext : <code_snipet> export const HighlightContext = createContext(false); </code_snipet> Your List component can wrap every item it renders into a HighlightContext provider: <code_snipet> export default function List({ items, renderItem }) { const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0); return ( <div className=\"List\"> {items.map((item, index) => { const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex; return ( <HighlightContext.Provider key={item.id} value={isHighlighted}> {renderItem(item)} </HighlightContext.Provider> ); })}'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='index) => { const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex; return ( <HighlightContext.Provider key={item.id} value={isHighlighted}> {renderItem(item)} </HighlightContext.Provider> ); })} </code_snipet> With this approach, Row does not need to receive an isHighlighted prop at all. Instead, it reads the context: <code_snipet> export default function Row({ title }) { const isHighlighted = useContext(HighlightContext); // ... </code_snipet> This allows the calling component to not know or worry about passing isHighlighted to <Row> : <code_snipet> <List items={products} renderItem={product => <Row title={product.title} /> }/> </code_snipet> Instead, List and Row coordinate the highlighting logic through context. App.js List.js Row.js HighlightContext.js data.js List.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; import { HighlightContext } from \\'./HighlightContext.js\\'; export default function List({ items, renderItem }) { const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0); return ( <div className=\"List\"> {items.map((item, index) => { const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex; return ( <HighlightContext.Provider key={item.id} value={isHighlighted} > {renderItem(item)} </HighlightContext.Provider> ); })} <hr /> <button onClick={() => { setSelectedIndex(i => (i + 1) % items.length ); }}> Next </button> </div> ); } Show more Learn more about passing data through context. Extracting logic into a custom Hook Another approach you can try is to extract the “non-visual” logic into your own Hook, and use the information returned by your Hook to decide what to render. For example, you could write a useList custom Hook like this: <code_snipet> import { useState } from \\'react\\';export default function useList(items) { const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0); function onNext() { setSelectedIndex(i => (i + 1) % items.length ); } const selected = items[selectedIndex]; return [selected, onNext];} </code_snipet> Then you could use it like this: <code_snipet> export'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='onNext() { setSelectedIndex(i => (i + 1) % items.length ); } const selected = items[selectedIndex]; return [selected, onNext];} </code_snipet> Then you could use it like this: <code_snipet> export default function App() { const [selected, onNext] = useList(products); return ( <div className=\"List\"> {products.map(product => <Row key={product.id} title={product.title} isHighlighted={selected === product} /> )} <hr /> <button onClick={onNext}> Next </button> </div> );} </code_snipet> The data flow is explicit, but the state is inside the useList custom Hook that you can use from any component: App.js useList.js Row.js data.js App.js Reset Fork import Row from \\'./Row.js\\'; import useList from \\'./useList.js\\'; import { products } from \\'./data.js\\'; export default function App() { const [selected, onNext] = useList(products); return ( <div className=\"List\"> {products.map(product => <Row key={product.id} title={product.title} isHighlighted={selected === product} /> )} <hr /> <button onClick={onNext}> Next </button> </div> ); } Show more This approach is particularly useful if you want to reuse this logic between different components.

See more examples below. context The context of a class component is available as this.context . It is only available if you specify which context you want to receive using static contextType . A class component can only read one context at a time. <code_snipet> class Button extends Component { static contextType = ThemeContext; render() { const theme = this.context; const className = 'button-' + theme; return ( <button className={className}> {this.props.children} </button> ); }} </code_snipet> Note\"),\n",

See how to migrate. props The props passed to a class component are available as this.props . <code_snipet> class Greeting extends Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>; }}<Greeting name=\"Taylor\" /> </code_snipet> Note Reading this.props in class components is equivalent to declaring props in function components. See how to migrate. state The state of a class component is available as this.state . The state field must be an object. Do not mutate the state directly. If you wish to change the state, call setState with the new state. <code_snipet> class Counter extends Component { state = { age: 42, }; handleAgeChange = () => { this.setState({ age: this.state.age + 1 }); }; render() { return ( <> <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}> Increment age </button> <p>You are {this.state.age}.</p> </> ); }} </code_snipet> Note Defining state in class components is equivalent to calling useState in function components. See how to migrate. constructor(props) The constructor runs before your class component mounts (gets added to the screen). Typically, a constructor is only used for two purposes in React. It lets you declare state and bind your class methods to the class instance: <code_snipet> class Counter extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { counter: 0 }; this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); } handleClick() { // ... } </code_snipet> If you use modern JavaScript syntax, constructors are rarely needed. Instead, you can rewrite this code above using the public class field syntax which is supported both by modern browsers and tools like Babel: <code_snipet> class Counter extends Component { state = { counter: 0 }; handleClick = ()'),\n",

Parameters props : The component’s initial props. Returns constructor should not return anything. Caveats Do not run any side effects or subscriptions in the constructor. Instead, use componentDidMount for that. Inside a constructor, you need to call super(props) before any other statement. If you don’t do that, this.props will be undefined while the constructor runs, which can be confusing and cause bugs. Constructor is the only place where you can assign this.state directly. In all other methods, you need to use this.setState() instead. Do not call setState in the constructor. When you use server rendering, the constructor will run on the server too, followed by the render method. However, lifecycle methods like componentDidMount or componentWillUnmount will not run on the server. When Strict Mode is on, React will call constructor twice in development and then throw away one of the instances. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the constructor . Note There is no exact equivalent for constructor in function components. To declare state in a function component, call useState . To avoid recalculating the initial state, pass a function to useState . componentDidCatch(error, info) If you define componentDidCatch , React will call it when some child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you log that error to an error reporting service in production. Typically, it is used together with static getDerivedStateFromError which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. A component with these methods is called an error boundary. See an example. Parameters'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. A component with these methods is called an error boundary. See an example. Parameters error : The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null . info : An object containing additional information about the error. Its componentStack field contains a stack trace with the component that threw, as well as the names and source locations of all its parent components. In production, the component names will be minified. If you set up production error reporting, you can decode the component stack using sourcemaps the same way as you would do for regular JavaScript error stacks. Returns componentDidCatch should not return anything. Caveats In the past, it was common to call setState inside componentDidCatch in order to update the UI and display the fallback error message. This is deprecated in favor of defining static getDerivedStateFromError . Production and development builds of React slightly differ in the way componentDidCatch handles errors. In development, the errors will bubble up to window , which means that any window.onerror or window.addEventListener('error', callback) will intercept the errors that have been caught by componentDidCatch . In production, instead, the errors will not bubble up, which means any ancestor error handler will only receive errors not explicitly caught by componentDidCatch . Note There is no direct equivalent for componentDidCatch in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single ErrorBoundary component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, you can use the react-error-boundary package which does that for you. componentDidMount() If you define the componentDidMount method, React will call it when your component is added (mounted) to the screen.

If you implement componentDidMount , you usually need to implement other lifecycle methods to avoid bugs. For example, if componentDidMount reads some state or props, you also have to implement componentDidUpdate to handle their changes, and componentWillUnmount to clean up whatever componentDidMount was doing. <code_snipet> class ChatRoom extends Component { state = { serverUrl: ' }; componentDidMount() { this.setupConnection(); } componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) { if ( this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId || this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl ) { this.destroyConnection(); this.setupConnection(); } } componentWillUnmount() { this.destroyConnection(); } // ...} </code_snipet> See more examples.

In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match. See how to migrate. componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot?) If you define the componentDidUpdate method, React will call it immediately after your component has been re-rendered with updated props or state. This method is not called for the initial render. You can use it to manipulate the DOM after an update. This is also a common place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed).

This is a common place to cancel data fetching or remove subscriptions. The logic inside componentWillUnmount should “mirror” the logic inside componentDidMount . For example, if componentDidMount sets up a subscription, componentWillUnmount should clean up that subscription. If the cleanup logic in your componentWillUnmount reads some props or state, you will usually also need to implement componentDidUpdate to clean up resources (such as subscriptions) corresponding to the old props and state. <code_snipet> class ChatRoom extends Component { state = { serverUrl: ' }; componentDidMount() { this.setupConnection(); } componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) { if ( this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId || this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl ) { this.destroyConnection(); this.setupConnection(); } } componentWillUnmount() { this.destroyConnection(); } // ...} </code_snipet> See more examples.

In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match. See how to migrate. forceUpdate(callback?) Forces a component to re-render. Usually, this is not necessary. If your component’s render method only reads from this.props , this.state , or this.context , it will re-render automatically when you call setState inside your component or one of its parents. However, if your component’s render method reads directly from an external data source, you have to tell React to update the user interface when that data source changes. That’s what forceUpdate lets you do. Try to avoid all uses of forceUpdate and only read from this.props and this.state in render . Parameters optional callback If specified, React will call the callback you’ve provided after the update is committed. Returns forceUpdate does not return anything. Caveats If you call forceUpdate , React will re-render without calling shouldComponentUpdate . Note Reading an external data source and forcing class components to re-render in response to its changes with forceUpdate has been superseded by useSyncExternalStore in function components. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) If you implement getSnapshotBeforeUpdate , React will call it immediately before React updates the DOM. It enables your component to capture some information from the DOM (e.g. scroll position) before it is potentially changed. Any value returned by this lifecycle method will be passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate . For example, you can use it in a UI like a chat thread that needs to preserve its scroll'),\n",

It is not safe to read it in render , UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps , or UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate because there is a potential time gap between these methods getting called and React updating the DOM. Parameters prevProps : Props before the update. Compare prevProps to this.props to determine what changed. prevState : State before the update. Compare prevState to this.state to determine what changed. Returns You should return a snapshot value of any type that you’d like, or null .

Note At the moment, there is no equivalent to getSnapshotBeforeUpdate for function components. This use case is very uncommon, but if you have the need for it, for now you’ll have to write a class component. render() The render method is the only required method in a class component. The render method should specify what you want to appear on the screen, for example: <code_snipet> import { Component } from 'react';class Greeting extends Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>; }} </code_snipet> React may call render at any moment, so you shouldn’t assume that it runs at a particular time. Usually, the render method should return a piece of JSX , but a few other return types (like strings) are supported. To calculate the returned JSX, the render method can read this.props , this.state , and this.context . You should write the render method as a pure function, meaning that it should return the same result if props, state, and context are the same. It also shouldn’t contain side effects (like setting up subscriptions) or interact with the browser APIs. Side effects should happen either in event handlers or methods like componentDidMount . Parameters render does not take any parameters. Returns render can return any valid React node. This includes React elements such as <div /> , strings, numbers, portals , empty nodes ( null , undefined , true , and false ), and arrays of React nodes. Caveats render should be written as a pure function of props, state, and context. It should not have side effects. render will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false .

There is no one-to-one correspondence between the render call and the subsequent componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate call. Some of the render call results may be discarded by React when it’s beneficial. setState(nextState, callback?) Call setState to update the state of your React component. <code_snipet> class Form extends Component { state = { name: \\'Taylor\\', }; handleNameChange = (e) => { const newName = e.target.value; this.setState({ name: newName }); } render() { return ( <> <input value={this.state.name} onChange={this.handleNameChange} /> <p>Hello, {this.state.name}.</p> </> ); }} </code_snipet> setState enqueues changes to the component state. It tells React that this component and its children need to re-render with the new state. This is the main way you’ll update the user interface in response to interactions. Pitfall Calling setState does not change the current state in the already executing code: <code_snipet> function handleClick() { console.log(this.state.name); // \"Taylor\" this.setState({ name: \\'Robin\\' }); console.log(this.state.name); // Still \"Taylor\"!} </code_snipet> It only affects what this.state will return starting from the next render. You can also pass a function to setState . It lets you update state based on the previous state: <code_snipet> handleIncreaseAge = () => { this.setState(prevState => { return { age: prevState.age + 1 }; }); } </code_snipet> You don’t have to do this, but it’s handy if you want to update state multiple times during the same event. Parameters nextState : Either an object or a function. If you pass an object as nextState , it will be shallowly merged into this.state . If you pass a function as nextState , it will be treated as an updater function .

It must be pure, should take the pending state and props as arguments, and should return the object to be shallowly merged into this.state . React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state. optional callback : If specified, React will call the callback you’ve provided after the update is committed. Returns setState does not return anything. Caveats Think of setState as a request rather than an immediate command to update the component. When multiple components update their state in response to an event, React will batch their updates and re-render them together in a single pass at the end of the event. In the rare case that you need to force a particular state update to be applied synchronously, you may wrap it in flushSync , but this may hurt performance. setState does not update this.state immediately. This makes reading this.state right after calling setState a potential pitfall. Instead, use componentDidUpdate or the setState callback argument, either of which are guaranteed to fire after the update has been applied. If you need to set the state based on the previous state, you can pass a function to nextState as described above. Note Calling setState in class components is similar to calling a set function in function components.

Return false to tell React that re-rendering can be skipped. Caveats This method only exists as a performance optimization. If your component breaks without it, fix that first. Consider using PureComponent instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate by hand. PureComponent shallowly compares props and state, and reduces the chance that you’ll skip a necessary update. We do not recommend doing deep equality checks or using JSON.stringify in shouldComponentUpdate . It makes performance unpredictable and dependent on the data structure of every prop and state.

React doesn’t call UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate with initial props and state during mounting. Note There is no direct equivalent to UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate in function components. static contextType If you want to read this.context from your class component, you must specify which context it needs to read. The context you specify as the static contextType must be a value previously created by createContext . <code_snipet> class Button extends Component { static contextType = ThemeContext; render() { const theme = this.context; const className = \\'button-\\' + theme; return ( <button className={className}> {this.props.children} </button> ); }} </code_snipet> Note Reading this.context in class components is equivalent to useContext in function components. See how to migrate. static defaultProps You can define static defaultProps to set the default props for the class. They will be used for undefined and missing props, but not for null props. For example, here is how you define that the color prop should default to \\'blue\\' : <code_snipet> class Button extends Component { static defaultProps = { color: \\'blue\\' }; render() { return <button className={this.props.color}>click me</button>; }} </code_snipet> If the color prop is not provided or is undefined , it will be set by default to \\'blue\\' : <code_snipet> <> {/* this.props.color is \"blue\" */} <Button /> {/* this.props.color is \"blue\" */} <Button color={undefined} /> {/* this.props.color is null */} <Button color={null} /> {/* this.props.color is \"red\" */} <Button color=\"red\" /></> </code_snipet> Note Defining defaultProps in class components is similar to using default values in'),\n",

This lets you display an error message instead of clearing the UI. Typically, it is used together with componentDidCatch which lets you send the error report to some analytics service. A component with these methods is called an error boundary. See an example. Parameters error : The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null . Returns static getDerivedStateFromError should return the state telling the component to display the error message. Caveats static getDerivedStateFromError should be a pure function. If you want to perform a side effect (for example, to call an analytics service), you need to also implement componentDidCatch . Note There is no direct equivalent for static getDerivedStateFromError in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single ErrorBoundary component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, use the react-error-boundary package which does that. static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) If you define static getDerivedStateFromProps , React will call it right before calling render , both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing. This method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time. For example, this Form component resets the email state when the userID prop changes: <code_snipet> class Form extends Component { state = { email:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"the state depends on changes in props over time. For example, this Form component resets the email state when the userID prop changes: <code_snipet> class Form extends Component { state = { email: this.props.defaultEmail, prevUserID: this.props.userID }; static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) { // Any time the current user changes, // Reset any parts of state that are tied to that user. // In this simple example, that's just the email. if (props.userID !== state.prevUserID) { return { prevUserID: props.userID, email: props.defaultEmail }; } return null; } // ...} </code_snipet> Note that this pattern requires you to keep a previous value of the prop (like userID ) in state (like prevUserID ). Pitfall Deriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about. Make sure you’re familiar with simpler alternatives: If you need to perform a side effect (for example, data fetching or an animation) in response to a change in props, use componentDidUpdate method instead. If you want to re-compute some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead. If you want to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead. Parameters props : The next props that the component is about to render with. state : The next state that the component is about to render with. Returns static getDerivedStateFromProps return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing. Caveats This method is fired on every render, regardless of the cause. This is different from UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps , which only fires when the parent causes a re-render and not as a result of a local setState . This method doesn’t have access to the component instance.

Note Implementing static getDerivedStateFromProps in a class component is equivalent to calling the set function from useState during rendering in a function component. Usage Defining a class component To define a React component as a class, extend the built-in Component class and define a render method: <code_snipet> import { Component } from \\'react\\';class Greeting extends Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>; }} </code_snipet> React will call your render method whenever it needs to figure out what to display on the screen. Usually, you will return some JSX from it. Your render method should be a pure function: it should only calculate the JSX. Similarly to function components, a class component can receive information by props from its parent component. However, the syntax for reading props is different. For example, if the parent component renders <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" /> , then you can read the name prop from this.props , like this.props.name : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { Component } from \\'react\\'; class Greeting extends Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>; } } export default function App() { return ( <> <Greeting name=\"Sara\" /> <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" /> <Greeting name=\"Edite\" /> </> ); } Show more Note that Hooks (functions starting with use , like useState ) are not supported inside class components. Pitfall We recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate. Adding state to a class component To add state to a class, assign an object to a property called state . To update state, call this.setState . App.js App.js Reset Fork import { Component } from \\'react\\'; export default class Counter extends Component { state = { name: \\'Taylor\\', age: 42, }; handleNameChange = (e) => {'),\n",

You are {this.state.age}.</p> </> ); } } Show more Pitfall We recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate. Adding lifecycle methods to a class component There are a few special methods you can define on your class. If you define the componentDidMount method, React will call it when your component is added (mounted) to the screen. React will call componentDidUpdate after your component re-renders due to changed props or state. React will call componentWillUnmount after your component has been removed (unmounted) from the screen. If you implement componentDidMount , you usually need to implement all three lifecycles to avoid bugs. For example, if componentDidMount reads some state or props, you also have to implement componentDidUpdate to handle their changes, and componentWillUnmount to clean up whatever componentDidMount was doing. For example, this ChatRoom component keeps a chat connection synchronized with props and state: App.js ChatRoom.js chat.js ChatRoom.js Reset Fork import { Component } from 'react'; import { createConnection } from './chat.js'; export default class ChatRoom extends Component { state = { serverUrl: ' }; componentDidMount() { this.setupConnection(); } componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) { if ( this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId || this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl ) { this.destroyConnection(); this.setupConnection(); } } componentWillUnmount() { this.destroyConnection(); } setupConnection() {\"),\n",

This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does. Pitfall We recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate. Catching rendering errors with an error boundary By default, if your application throws an error during rendering, React will remove its UI from the screen. To prevent this, you can wrap a part of your UI into an error boundary . An error boundary is a special component that lets you display some fallback UI instead of the part that crashed—for example, an error message. To implement an error boundary component, you need to provide static getDerivedStateFromError which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. You can also optionally implement componentDidCatch to add some extra logic, for example, to log the error to an analytics service. <code_snipet> class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { hasError: false }; } static getDerivedStateFromError(error) { // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI. return { hasError: true }; } componentDidCatch(error,\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='this.state = { hasError: false }; } static getDerivedStateFromError(error) { // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI. return { hasError: true }; } componentDidCatch(error, info) { // Example \"componentStack\": // in ComponentThatThrows (created by App) // in ErrorBoundary (created by App) // in div (created by App) // in App logErrorToMyService(error, info.componentStack); } render() { if (this.state.hasError) { // You can render any custom fallback UI return this.props.fallback; } return this.props.children; }} </code_snipet> Then you can wrap a part of your component tree with it: <code_snipet> <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Something went wrong</p>}> <Profile /></ErrorBoundary> </code_snipet> If Profile or its child component throws an error, ErrorBoundary will “catch” that error, display a fallback UI with the error message you’ve provided, and send a production error report to your error reporting service. You don’t need to wrap every component into a separate error boundary. When you think about the granularity of error boundaries, consider where it makes sense to display an error message. For example, in a messaging app, it makes sense to place an error boundary around the list of conversations. It also makes sense to place one around every individual message. However, it wouldn’t make sense to place a boundary around every avatar. Note There is currently no way to write an error boundary as a function component. However, you don’t have to write the error boundary class yourself. For example, you can use react-error-boundary instead. Alternatives Migrating a simple component from a class to a function Typically, you will define components as functions instead. For example, suppose you’re converting this Greeting class component to a function: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { Component } from \\'react\\'; class Greeting extends Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>; } } export default function App() { return ( <>'),\n",

This is where you will move the body of your render function. <code_snipet> function Greeting() { // ... move the code from the render method here ...} </code_snipet> Instead of this.props.name , define the name prop using the destructuring syntax and read it directly: <code_snipet> function Greeting({ name }) { return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;} </code_snipet> Here is a complete example: App.js App.js Reset Fork function Greeting({ name }) { return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>; } export default function App() { return ( <> <Greeting name=\"Sara\" /> <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" /> <Greeting name=\"Edite\" /> </> ); } Migrating a component with state from a class to a function Suppose you’re converting this Counter class component to a function: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { Component } from \\'react\\'; export default class Counter extends Component { state = { name: \\'Taylor\\', age: 42, }; handleNameChange = (e) => { this.setState({ name: e.target.value }); } handleAgeChange = (e) => { this.setState({ age: this.state.age + 1 }); }; render() { return ( <> <input value={this.state.name} onChange={this.handleNameChange} /> <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}> Increment age </button> <p>Hello, {this.state.name}. You are {this.state.age}.</p> </> ); } } Show more Start by declaring a function with the necessary state variables: <code_snipet> import { useState } from \\'react\\';function Counter() { const [name, setName] = useState(\\'Taylor\\'); const [age, setAge] = useState(42); // ... </code_snipet> Next, convert the event handlers: <code_snipet> function Counter() { const [name, setName] = useState(\\'Taylor\\'); const [age, setAge] = useState(42); function'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"= useState(42); // ... </code_snipet> Next, convert the event handlers: <code_snipet> function Counter() { const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor'); const [age, setAge] = useState(42); function handleNameChange(e) { setName(e.target.value); } function handleAgeChange() { setAge(age + 1); } // ... </code_snipet> Finally, replace all references starting with this with the variables and functions you defined in your component. For example, replace this.state.age with age , and replace this.handleNameChange with handleNameChange . Here is a fully converted component: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Counter() { const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor'); const [age, setAge] = useState(42); function handleNameChange(e) { setName(e.target.value); } function handleAgeChange() { setAge(age + 1); } return ( <> <input value={name} onChange={handleNameChange} /> <button onClick={handleAgeChange}> Increment age </button> <p>Hello, {name}. You are {age}.</p> </> ) } Show more Migrating a component with lifecycle methods from a class to a function Suppose you’re converting this ChatRoom class component with lifecycle methods to a function: App.js ChatRoom.js chat.js ChatRoom.js Reset Fork import { Component } from 'react'; import { createConnection } from './chat.js'; export default class ChatRoom extends Component { state = { serverUrl: ' }; componentDidMount() { this.setupConnection(); } componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) { if ( this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId || this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl ) { this.destroyConnection(); this.setupConnection(); } } componentWillUnmount() { this.destroyConnection(); } setupConnection() { this.connection = createConnection( this.state.serverUrl, this.props.roomId ); this.connection.connect(); } destroyConnection() { this.connection.disconnect(); this.connection = null; } render() { return ( <> <label> Server URL:{' '} <input value={this.state.serverUrl} onChange={e\"),\n",

In the above example, that’s true: it disconnects the connection that componentDidMount sets up. If such logic is missing, add it first. Next, verify that your componentDidUpdate method handles changes to any props and state you’re using in componentDidMount . In the above example, componentDidMount calls setupConnection which reads this.state.serverUrl and this.props.roomId . This is why componentDidUpdate checks whether this.state.serverUrl and this.props.roomId have changed, and resets the connection if they did. If your componentDidUpdate logic is missing or doesn’t handle changes to all relevant props and state, fix that first. In the above example, the logic inside the lifecycle methods connects the component to a system outside of React (a chat server). To connect a component to an external system, describe this logic as a single Effect: <code_snipet> import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState(' useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ...} </code_snipet> This useEffect call is equivalent to the logic in the lifecycle methods above. If your lifecycle methods do multiple unrelated things, split them into multiple independent Effects. Here is a complete example you can play with: App.js ChatRoom.js chat.js ChatRoom.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; import { createConnection } from './chat.js'; export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const\"),\n",

Parameters type : The type argument must be a valid React component type. For example, it could be a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span' ), or a React component (a function, a class, or a special component like Fragment ). props : The props argument must either be an object or null . If you pass null , it will be treated the same as an empty object. React will create an element with props matching the props you have passed. Note that ref and key from your props object are special and will not be available as element.props.ref and element.props.key on the returned element . They will be available as element.ref and element.key . optional ...children : Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, portals , empty nodes ( null , undefined , true , and false ), and arrays of React nodes. Returns createElement returns a React element object with a few properties: type : The type you have passed. props : The props you have passed except for ref and key . ref : The ref you have passed. If missing, null . key : The key you have passed, coerced to a string. If missing, null . Usually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it. Caveats You must treat React elements and their props as immutable and never change their contents after creation. In development, React will freeze the returned element and its props property shallowly to enforce this. When you use JSX, you must start a tag with a capital letter to render your own custom component. In other words, <Something /> is equivalent to createElement(Something) , but <something /> (lowercase) is\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='you use JSX, you must start a tag with a capital letter to render your own custom component. In other words, <Something /> is equivalent to createElement(Something) , but <something /> (lowercase) is equivalent to createElement(\\'something\\') (note it’s a string, so it will be treated as a built-in HTML tag). You should only pass children as multiple arguments to createElement if they are all statically known, like createElement(\\'h1\\', {}, child1, child2, child3) . If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: createElement(\\'ul\\', {}, listItems) . This ensures that React will warn you about missing key s for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder. Usage Creating an element without JSX If you don’t like JSX or can’t use it in your project, you can use createElement as an alternative. To create an element without JSX, call createElement with some type , props , and children : <code_snipet> import { createElement } from \\'react\\';function Greeting({ name }) { return createElement( \\'h1\\', { className: \\'greeting\\' }, \\'Hello \\', createElement(\\'i\\', null, name), \\'. Welcome!\\' );} </code_snipet> The children are optional, and you can pass as many as you need (the example above has three children). This code will display a <h1> header with a greeting. For comparison, here is the same example rewritten with JSX: <code_snipet> function Greeting({ name }) { return ( <h1 className=\"greeting\"> Hello <i>{name}</i>. Welcome! </h1> );} </code_snipet> To render your own React component, pass a function like Greeting as the type instead of a string like \\'h1\\' : <code_snipet> export default function App() { return createElement(Greeting, { name: \\'Taylor\\' });} </code_snipet> With JSX, it would look like this: <code_snipet> export default function App() { return <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />;} </code_snipet> Here is a complete example written with createElement : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { createElement } from \\'react\\';'),\n",

Welcome! </h1> ); } export default function App() { return <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />; } Both coding styles are fine, so you can use whichever one you prefer for your project. The main benefit of using JSX compared to createElement is that it’s easy to see which closing tag corresponds to which opening tag. Deep Dive What is a React element, exactly? Show Details An element is a lightweight description of a piece of the user interface. For example, both <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" /> and createElement(Greeting, { name: \\'Taylor\\' }) produce an object like this: <code_snipet> // Slightly simplified{ type: Greeting, props: { name: \\'Taylor\\' }, key: null, ref: null,} </code_snipet> Note that creating this object does not render the Greeting component or create any DOM elements. A React element is more like a description—an instruction for React to later render the Greeting component. By returning this object from your App component, you tell React what to do next. Creating elements is extremely cheap so you don’t need to try to optimize or avoid it. Previous Component Next createRef Copyright © Meta Platforms, Inc no uwu plz uwu?

Parameters createRef takes no parameters. Returns createRef returns an object with a single property: current : Initially, it’s set to the null . You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current property. Caveats createRef always returns a different object. It’s equivalent to writing { current: null } yourself. In a function component, you probably want useRef instead which always returns the same object. const ref = useRef() is equivalent to const [ref, _] = useState(() => createRef(null)) .

Parameters render : The render function for your component. React calls this function with the props and ref that your component received from its parent. The JSX you return will be the output of your component. Returns forwardRef returns a React component that you can render in JSX. Unlike React components defined as plain functions, a component returned by forwardRef is also able to receive a ref prop. Caveats In Strict Mode, React will call your render function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your render function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the logic of your component. The result from one of the calls will be ignored. render function forwardRef accepts a render function as an argument.

Unlike React components defined as plain functions, the component returned by forwardRef is able to take a ref prop. Usage Exposing a DOM node to the parent component By default, each component’s DOM nodes are private. However, sometimes it’s useful to expose a DOM node to the parent—for example, to allow focusing it. To opt in, wrap your component definition into forwardRef() : <code_snipet> import { forwardRef } from \\'react\\';const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) { const { label, ...otherProps } = props; return ( <label> {label} <input {...otherProps} /> </label> );}); </code_snipet> You will receive a ref as the second argument after props.

The MyInput component forwards that ref to the <input> browser tag. As a result, the Form component can access that <input> DOM node and call focus() on it. Keep in mind that exposing a ref to the DOM node inside your component makes it harder to change your component’s internals later. You will typically expose DOM nodes from reusable low-level components like buttons or text inputs, but you won’t do it for application-level components like an avatar or a comment.

You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on. If you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like { open, close } from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like <Modal isOpen={isOpen} /> . Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props. Troubleshooting My component is wrapped in forwardRef , but the ref to it is always null This usually means that you forgot to actually use the ref that you received. For example, this component doesn’t do anything with its ref : <code_snipet> const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label }, ref) { return ( <label> {label} <input /> </label> );}); </code_snipet> To fix it, pass the ref down to a DOM node or another component that can accept a ref: <code_snipet> const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label }, ref) { return ( <label> {label} <input ref={ref} /> </label> );}); </code_snipet> The ref to MyInput could also be null if some of the logic is conditional: <code_snipet> const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label, showInput }, ref) { return ( <label> {label} {showInput && <input ref={ref} />} </label> );}); </code_snipet> If showInput is false , then the ref won’t be forwarded to any node, and a ref to MyInput will remain empty. This is particularly easy to miss if the condition is hidden inside another component, like Panel in this example: <code_snipet> const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label, showInput }, ref) { return ( <label> {label} <Panel isExpanded={showInput}> <input ref={ref} /> </Panel> </label> );}); </code_snipet> Previous createRef Next isValidElement Copyright © Meta Platforms, Inc no uwu plz uwu?

React elements are: Values produced by writing a JSX tag Values produced by calling createElement For React elements, isValidElement returns true : <code_snipet> import { isValidElement, createElement } from 'react';// ✅ JSX tags are React elementsconsole.log(isValidElement(<p />)); // trueconsole.log(isValidElement(<MyComponent />)); // true// ✅ Values returned by createElement are React elementsconsole.log(isValidElement(createElement('p'))); // trueconsole.log(isValidElement(createElement(MyComponent))); // true </code_snipet> Any other values, such as strings, numbers, or arbitrary objects and arrays, are not React elements. For them, isValidElement returns false : <code_snipet> // ❌ These are *not* React elementsconsole.log(isValidElement(null)); // falseconsole.log(isValidElement(25)); // falseconsole.log(isValidElement('Hello')); // falseconsole.log(isValidElement({ age: 42 })); // falseconsole.log(isValidElement([<div />, <div />])); // falseconsole.log(isValidElement(MyComponent)); // false </code_snipet> It is very\"),\n",

It’s mostly useful if you’re calling another API that only accepts elements (like cloneElement does) and you want to avoid an error when your argument is not a React element. Unless you have some very specific reason to add an isValidElement check, you probably don’t need it. Deep Dive React elements vs React nodes Show Details When you write a component, you can return any kind of React node from it: <code_snipet> function MyComponent() { // ... you can return any React node ...} </code_snipet> A React node can be: A React element created like <div /> or createElement('div') A portal created with createPortal A string A number true , false , null , or undefined (which are not displayed) An array of other React nodes Note isValidElement checks whether the argument is a React element, not whether it’s a React node. For example, 42 is not a valid React element. However, it is a perfectly valid React node: <code_snipet> function MyComponent() { return 42; // It's ok to return a number from component} </code_snipet> This is why you shouldn’t use isValidElement as a way to check whether something can be rendered.

Extending PureComponent is equivalent to defining a custom shouldComponentUpdate method that shallowly compares props and state. See more examples below. Usage Skipping unnecessary re-renders for class components React normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. As an optimization, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props and state are the same as the old props and state. Class components can opt into this behavior by extending PureComponent : <code_snipet> class Greeting extends PureComponent { render() { return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>; }} </code_snipet> A React component should always have pure rendering logic. This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using PureComponent , you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props and state haven’t changed. However, your component will still re-render if a context that it’s using changes. In this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop): App.js App.js Reset Fork import { PureComponent, useState } from \\'react\\'; class Greeting extends PureComponent { render() { console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new'),\n",

You will learn How to create and nest components How to add markup and styles How to display data How to render conditions and lists How to respond to events and update the screen How to share data between components Creating and nesting components React apps are made out of components . A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. React components are JavaScript functions that return markup: <code_snipet> function MyButton() { return ( <button>I'm a button</button>\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. React components are JavaScript functions that return markup: <code_snipet> function MyButton() { return ( <button>I\\'m a button</button> );} </code_snipet> Now that you’ve declared MyButton , you can nest it into another component: <code_snipet> export default function MyApp() { return ( <div> <h1>Welcome to my app</h1> <MyButton /> </div> );} </code_snipet> Notice that <MyButton /> starts with a capital letter. That’s how you know it’s a React component. React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase. Have a look at the result: App.js App.js Reset Fork function MyButton() { return ( <button> I\\'m a button </button> ); } export default function MyApp() { return ( <div> <h1>Welcome to my app</h1> <MyButton /> </div> ); } Show more The export default keywords specify the main component in the file. If you’re not familiar with some piece of JavaScript syntax, MDN and javascript.info have great references. Writing markup with JSX The markup syntax you’ve seen above is called JSX . It is optional, but most React projects use JSX for its convenience. All of the tools we recommend for local development support JSX out of the box. JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like <br /> . Your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper: <code_snipet> function AboutPage() { return ( <> <h1>About</h1> <p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p> </> );} </code_snipet> If you have a lot of HTML to port to JSX, you can use an online converter. Adding styles In React, you specify a CSS class with className . It works the same way as the HTML class attribute: <code_snipet> <img className=\"avatar\" /> </code_snipet> Then you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file: <code_snipet> /* In your CSS */.avatar { border-radius: 50%;} </code_snipet> React does not prescribe'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='className=\"avatar\" /> </code_snipet> Then you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file: <code_snipet> /* In your CSS */.avatar { border-radius: 50%;} </code_snipet> React does not prescribe how you add CSS files. In the simplest case, you’ll add a <link> tag to your HTML. If you use a build tool or a framework, consult its documentation to learn how to add a CSS file to your project. Displaying data JSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you “escape back” into JavaScript so that you can embed some variable from your code and display it to the user. For example, this will display user.name : <code_snipet> return ( <h1> {user.name} </h1>); </code_snipet> You can also “escape into JavaScript” from JSX attributes, but you have to use curly braces instead of quotes. For example, className=\"avatar\" passes the \"avatar\" string as the CSS class, but src={user.imageUrl} reads the JavaScript user.imageUrl variable value, and then passes that value as the src attribute: <code_snipet> return ( <img className=\"avatar\" src={user.imageUrl} />); </code_snipet> You can put more complex expressions inside the JSX curly braces too, for example, string concatenation : App.js App.js Reset Fork const user = { name: \\'Hedy Lamarr\\', imageUrl: \\' imageSize: 90, }; export default function Profile() { return ( <> <h1>{user.name}</h1> <img className=\"avatar\" src={user.imageUrl} alt={\\'Photo of \\' + user.name} style={{ width: user.imageSize, height: user.imageSize }} /> </> ); } Show more In the above example, style={{}} is not a special syntax, but a regular {} object inside the style={ } JSX curly braces. You can use the style attribute when your styles depend on JavaScript variables. Conditional rendering In React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions. Instead, you’ll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code. For example, you can use an if statement to conditionally include JSX: <code_snipet> let content;if (isLoggedIn) {'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"you’ll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code. For example, you can use an if statement to conditionally include JSX: <code_snipet> let content;if (isLoggedIn) { content = <AdminPanel />;} else { content = <LoginForm />;}return ( <div> {content} </div>); </code_snipet> If you prefer more compact code, you can use the conditional ? operator. Unlike if , it works inside JSX: <code_snipet> <div> {isLoggedIn ? ( <AdminPanel /> ) : ( <LoginForm /> )}</div> </code_snipet> When you don’t need the else branch, you can also use a shorter logical && syntax : <code_snipet> <div> {isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}</div> </code_snipet> All of these approaches also work for conditionally specifying attributes. If you’re unfamiliar with some of this JavaScript syntax, you can start by always using if...else . Rendering lists You will rely on JavaScript features like for loop and the array map() function to render lists of components. For example, let’s say you have an array of products: <code_snipet> const products = [ { title: 'Cabbage', id: 1 }, { title: 'Garlic', id: 2 }, { title: 'Apple', id: 3 },]; </code_snipet> Inside your component, use the map() function to transform an array of products into an array of <li> items: <code_snipet> const listItems = products.map(product => <li key={product.id}> {product.title} </li>);return ( <ul>{listItems}</ul>); </code_snipet> Notice how <li> has a key attribute. For each item in a list, you should pass a string or a number that uniquely identifies that item among its siblings. Usually, a key should be coming from your data, such as a database ID. React uses your keys to know what happened if you later insert, delete, or reorder the items. App.js App.js Reset Fork const products = [ { title: 'Cabbage', isFruit: false, id: 1 }, { title: 'Garlic', isFruit: false, id: 2 }, { title: 'Apple', isFruit: true, id: 3 }, ]; export default function ShoppingList() { const listItems = products.map(product => <li\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"false, id: 1 }, { title: 'Garlic', isFruit: false, id: 2 }, { title: 'Apple', isFruit: true, id: 3 }, ]; export default function ShoppingList() { const listItems = products.map(product => <li key={product.id} style={{ color: product.isFruit ? 'magenta' : 'darkgreen' }} > {product.title} </li> ); return ( <ul>{listItems}</ul> ); } Show more Responding to events You can respond to events by declaring event handler functions inside your components: <code_snipet> function MyButton() { function handleClick() { alert('You clicked me!'); } return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> Click me </button> );} </code_snipet> Notice how onClick={handleClick} has no parentheses at the end! Do not call the event handler function: you only need to pass it down . React will call your event handler when the user clicks the button. Updating the screen Often, you’ll want your component to “remember” some information and display it. For example, maybe you want to count the number of times a button is clicked. To do this, add state to your component. First, import useState from React: <code_snipet> import { useState } from 'react'; </code_snipet> Now you can declare a state variable inside your component: <code_snipet> function MyButton() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // ... </code_snipet> You’ll get two things from useState : the current state ( count ), and the function that lets you update it ( setCount ). You can give them any names, but the convention is to write [something, setSomething] . The first time the button is displayed, count will be 0 because you passed 0 to useState() . When you want to change state, call setCount() and pass the new value to it. Clicking this button will increment the counter: <code_snipet> function MyButton() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> Clicked {count} times </button> );} </code_snipet> React will call your component function again. This time,\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> Clicked {count} times </button> );} </code_snipet> React will call your component function again. This time, count will be 1 . Then it will be 2 . And so on. If you render the same component multiple times, each will get its own state. Click each button separately: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function MyApp() { return ( <div> <h1>Counters that update separately</h1> <MyButton /> <MyButton /> </div> ); } function MyButton() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> Clicked {count} times </button> ); } Show more Notice how each button “remembers” its own count state and doesn’t affect other buttons. Using Hooks Functions starting with use are called Hooks . useState is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the API reference. You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones. Hooks are more restrictive than other functions. You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there. Sharing data between components In the previous example, each MyButton had its own independent count , and when each button was clicked, only the count for the button clicked changed: Initially, each MyButton ’s count state is 0 The first MyButton updates its count to 1 However, often you’ll need components to share data and always update together . To make both MyButton components display the same count and update together, you need to move the state from the individual buttons “upwards” to the closest component containing all of them. In this example, it is MyApp : Initially, MyApp ’s count state is 0 and is passed down to both children On click, MyApp updates its count state to 1 and passes it down to both children\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"all of them. In this example, it is MyApp : Initially, MyApp ’s count state is 0 and is passed down to both children On click, MyApp updates its count state to 1 and passes it down to both children Now when you click either button, the count in MyApp will change, which will change both of the counts in MyButton . Here’s how you can express this in code. First, move the state up from MyButton into MyApp : <code_snipet> export default function MyApp() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( <div> <h1>Counters that update separately</h1> <MyButton /> <MyButton /> </div> );}function MyButton() { // ... we're moving code from here ...} </code_snipet> Then, pass the state down from MyApp to each MyButton , together with the shared click handler. You can pass information to MyButton using the JSX curly braces, just like you previously did with built-in tags like <img> : <code_snipet> export default function MyApp() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( <div> <h1>Counters that update together</h1> <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} /> <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} /> </div> );} </code_snipet> The information you pass down like this is called props . Now the MyApp component contains the count state and the handleClick event handler, and passes both of them down as props to each of the buttons. Finally, change MyButton to read the props you have passed from its parent component: <code_snipet> function MyButton({ count, onClick }) { return ( <button onClick={onClick}> Clicked {count} times </button> );} </code_snipet> When you click the button, the onClick handler fires. Each button’s onClick prop was set to the handleClick function inside MyApp , so the code inside of it runs. That code calls setCount(count + 1) , incrementing the count state variable. The new count value is passed as a prop to each button, so they all show the new\"),\n",

A React render tree is a representation of the parent and child relationship between components. An example React render tree. Components near the top of the tree, near the root component, are considered top-level components. Components with no child components are leaf components. This categorization of components is useful for understanding data flow and rendering performance. Modelling the relationship between JavaScript modules is another useful way to understand your app. We refer to it as a module dependency tree. An example module dependency tree. A dependency tree is often used by build tools to bundle all the relevant JavaScript code for the client to download and render. A large bundle size regresses user experience for React apps.

Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” puts a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state. You can add state to a component with a useState Hook. Hooks are special functions that let your components use React features (state is one of those features).

Read More Preserving and resetting state When you re-render a component, React needs to decide which parts of the tree to keep (and update), and which parts to discard or re-create from scratch. In most cases, React’s automatic behavior works well enough. By default, React preserves the parts of the tree that “match up” with the previously rendered component tree. However, sometimes this is not what you want. In this chat app, typing a message and then switching the recipient does not reset the input. This can make the user accidentally send a message to the wrong person: App.js ContactList.js Chat.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; import Chat from \\'./Chat.js\\'; import ContactList from \\'./ContactList.js\\'; export default function Messenger() { const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]); return ( <div> <ContactList contacts={contacts} selectedContact={to} onSelect={contact => setTo(contact)} /> <Chat contact={to} /> </div> ) } const contacts = [ { name: \\'Taylor\\', email:  }, { name: \\'Alice\\', email:  }, { name: \\'Bob\\', email:  } ]; Show more React lets you override the default behavior, and force a component to reset its state by passing it a different key , like <Chat key={email} />'),\n",

Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it—no matter how deep it is—without passing it explicitly through props. Here, the Heading component determines its heading level by “asking” the closest Section for its level. Each Section tracks its own level by asking the parent Section and adding one to it.

There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a ref to the DOM node.

For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. Unlike event handlers, which let you handle particular events, Effects let you run some code after rendering. Use them to synchronize your component with a system outside of React. Press Play/Pause a few times and see how the video player stays synchronized to the isPlaying prop value: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { const ref = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { if (isPlaying) { ref.current.play(); } else { ref.current.pause(); } }, [isPlaying]); return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />; } export default function App() { const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false); return ( <> <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}> {isPlaying ? \\'Pause\\' : \\'Play\\'} </button> <VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} src=\" /> </> ); } Show more Many Effects also “clean up” after themselves. For example, an Effect that sets up a connection to a chat server should return a cleanup function that tells React how to disconnect your component from that server: App.js chat.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; import { createConnection } from \\'./chat.js\\'; export default function ChatRoom() {'),\n",

This is why you see \"✅ Connecting...\" printed twice. This ensures that you don’t forget to implement the cleanup function. Ready to learn this topic? Read Synchronizing with Effects to learn how to synchronize components with external systems. Read More You Might Not Need An Effect Effects are an escape hatch from the React paradigm. They let you “step outside” of React and synchronize your components with some external system. If there is no external system involved (for example, if you want to update a component’s state when some props or state change), you shouldn’t need an Effect. Removing unnecessary Effects will make your code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone. There are two common cases in which you don’t need Effects: You don’t need Effects to transform data for rendering. You don’t need Effects to handle user events. For example, you don’t need an Effect to adjust some state based on other state: <code_snipet> function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(\\'Taylor\\'); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(\\'Swift\\'); // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect const [fullName, setFullName] = useState(\\'\\'); useEffect(() => { setFullName(firstName + \\' \\' + lastName); }, [firstName, lastName]); // ...} </code_snipet> Instead, calculate as much as you can while rendering: <code_snipet> function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(\\'Taylor\\'); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(\\'Swift\\'); // ✅ Good: calculated during rendering const fullName = firstName + \\' \\' +'),\n",

Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your Effect depends on props and state that change over time. This Effect depends on the value of the roomId prop. Props are reactive values, which means they can change on a re-render. Notice that the Effect re-synchronizes (and re-connects to the server) if roomId changes: App.js chat.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; import { createConnection } from \\'./chat.js\\'; const serverUrl = \\' function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>; } export default function App() { const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState(\\'general\\'); return ( <> <label> Choose the chat room:{\\' \\'} <select value={roomId} onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)} > <option value=\"general\">general</option> <option value=\"travel\">travel</option> <option value=\"music\">music</option> </select> </label> <hr /> <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} /> </> ); } Show more React provides a linter rule to check that you’ve specified your Effect’s dependencies correctly.

Read More Separating events from Effects Under Construction This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React. Event handlers only re-run when you perform the same interaction again. Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if any of the values they read, like props or state, are different than during last render. Sometimes, you want a mix of both behaviors: an Effect that re-runs in response to some values but not others. All code inside Effects is reactive. It will run again if some reactive value it reads has changed due to a re-render. For example, this Effect will re-connect to the chat if either roomId or theme have changed: App.js chat.js notifications.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; import { createConnection, sendMessage } from \\'./chat.js\\'; import { showNotification } from \\'./notifications.js\\'; const serverUrl = \\' function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.on(\\'connected\\', () => { showNotification(\\'Connected!\\', theme); }); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId, theme]); return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1> } export default function App() { const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState(\\'general\\'); const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false); return ( <> <label> Choose the chat room:{\\' \\'} <select value={roomId} onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)} > <option value=\"general\">general</option> <option value=\"travel\">travel</option> <option value=\"music\">music</option> </select> </label> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={isDark} onChange={e => setIsDark(e.target.checked)} /> Use dark theme'),\n",

The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax. We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game above before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.

Setup for the tutorial In the live code editor below, click Fork in the top-right corner to open the editor in a new tab using the website CodeSandbox. CodeSandbox lets you write code in your browser and preview how your users will see the app you’ve created. The new tab should display an empty square and the starter code for this tutorial.

To do this, you need to: Install Node.js In the CodeSandbox tab you opened earlier, press the top-left corner button to open the menu, and then choose Download Sandbox in that menu to download an archive of the files locally Unzip the archive, then open a terminal and cd to the directory you unzipped Install the dependencies with npm install Run npm start to start a local server and follow the prompts to view the code running in a browser If you get stuck, don’t let this stop you! Follow along online instead and try a local setup again later. Overview Now that you’re set up, let’s get an overview of React! Inspecting the starter code In CodeSandbox you’ll see three main sections: The Files section with a list of files like App.js , index.js , styles.css and a folder called public The code editor where you’ll see the source code of your selected file The browser section where you’ll see how the code you’ve written will be displayed The App.js file should be selected in the Files section.

App.js The code in App.js creates a component . In React, a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application. Let’s look at the component line by line to see what’s going on: <code_snipet> export default function Square() { return <button className=\"square\">X</button>;} </code_snipet> The first line defines a function called Square . The export JavaScript keyword makes this function accessible outside of this file. The default keyword tells other files using your code that it’s the main function in your file. <code_snipet> export default function Square() { return <button className=\"square\">X</button>;} </code_snipet> The second line returns a button. The return JavaScript keyword means whatever comes after is returned as a value to the caller of the function. <button> is a JSX element . A JSX element is a combination of JavaScript code and HTML tags that describes what you’d like to display. className=\"square\" is a button property or prop that tells CSS how to style the button. X is the text displayed inside of the button and </button> closes the JSX element to indicate that any following content shouldn’t be placed inside the button. styles.css Click on the file labeled styles.css in the Files section of CodeSandbox. This file defines the styles for your React app. The first two CSS selectors ( * and body ) define the style of large parts of your app while the .square selector defines the style of any component where the className property is set to square . In your code, that would match the button from your Square component in the App.js file.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='while the .square selector defines the style of any component where the className property is set to square .

You won’t be editing this file during the tutorial but it is the bridge between the component you created in the App.js file and the web browser. <code_snipet> import { StrictMode } from \\'react\\';import { createRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\';import \\'./styles.css\\';import App from \\'./App\\'; </code_snipet> Lines 1-5 bring all the necessary pieces together: React React’s library to talk to web browsers (React DOM) the styles for your components the component you created in App.js . The remainder of the file brings all the pieces together and injects the final product into index.html in the public folder. Building the board Let’s get back to App.js . This is where you’ll spend the rest of the tutorial. Currently the board is only a single square, but you need nine! If you just try and copy paste your square to make two squares like this: <code_snipet> export default function Square() { return <button className=\"square\">X</button><button className=\"square\">X</button>;} </code_snipet> You’ll get this error: Console /src/App.js: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. Did you want a JSX Fragment <>...</> ? React components need to return a single JSX element and not multiple adjacent JSX elements like two buttons. To fix this you can use Fragments ( <> and </> ) to wrap multiple adjacent JSX elements like this: <code_snipet> export default function Square() { return ( <> <button className=\"square\">X</button> <button className=\"square\">X</button> </> );} </code_snipet> Now you should see: Great! Now you just need to copy-paste a few times to add nine squares and… Oh no! The squares are all in a single line, not in a grid like you need for our board. To fix this you’ll need to group'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Great! Now you just need to copy-paste a few times to add nine squares and… Oh no! The squares are all in a single line, not in a grid like you need for our board. To fix this you’ll need to group your squares into rows with div s and add some CSS classes. While you’re at it, you’ll give each square a number to make sure you know where each square is displayed. In the App.js file, update the Square component to look like this: <code_snipet> export default function Square() { return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <button className=\"square\">1</button> <button className=\"square\">2</button> <button className=\"square\">3</button> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <button className=\"square\">4</button> <button className=\"square\">5</button> <button className=\"square\">6</button> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <button className=\"square\">7</button> <button className=\"square\">8</button> <button className=\"square\">9</button> </div> </> );} </code_snipet> The CSS defined in styles.css styles the divs with the className of board-row . Now that you’ve grouped your components into rows with the styled div s you have your tic-tac-toe board: But you now have a problem. Your component named Square , really isn’t a square anymore. Let’s fix that by changing the name to Board : <code_snipet> export default function Board() { //...} </code_snipet> At this point your code should look something like this: App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function Board() { return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <button className=\"square\">1</button> <button className=\"square\">2</button> <button className=\"square\">3</button> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <button className=\"square\">4</button> <button className=\"square\">5</button> <button className=\"square\">6</button> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <button className=\"square\">7</button> <button className=\"square\">8</button> <button className=\"square\">9</button> </div> </> ); } Show more Note Psssst… That’s a lot to type!

It’s okay to copy and paste code from this page. However, if you’re up for a little challenge, we recommend only copying code that you’ve manually typed at least once yourself. Passing data through props Next, you’ll want to change the value of a square from empty to “X” when the user clicks on the square. With how you’ve built the board so far you would need to copy-paste the code that updates the square nine times (once for each square you have)! Instead of copy-pasting, React’s component architecture allows you to create a reusable component to avoid messy, duplicated code. First, you are going to copy the line defining your first square ( <button className=\"square\">1</button> ) from your Board component into a new Square component: <code_snipet> function Square() { return <button className=\"square\">1</button>;}export default function Board() { // ...} </code_snipet> Then you’ll update the Board component to render that Square component using JSX syntax: <code_snipet> // ...export default function Board() { return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square /> <Square /> <Square /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square /> <Square /> <Square /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square /> <Square /> <Square /> </div> </> );} </code_snipet> Note how unlike the browser div s, your own components Board and Square must start with a capital letter. Let’s take a look: Oh no! You lost the numbered squares you had before. Now each square says “1”. To fix this, you will use props to pass the value each square should have from the parent component ( Board ) to its child ( Square ). Update the Square component to read the value prop that you’ll pass from the Board : <code_snipet> function Square({ value }) { return <button className=\"square\">1</button>;} </code_snipet> function Square({ value })'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='component to read the value prop that you’ll pass from the Board : <code_snipet> function Square({ value }) { return <button className=\"square\">1</button>;} </code_snipet> function Square({ value }) indicates the Square component can be passed a prop called value . Now you want to display that value instead of 1 inside every square. Try doing it like this: <code_snipet> function Square({ value }) { return <button className=\"square\">value</button>;} </code_snipet> Oops, this is not what you wanted: You wanted to render the JavaScript variable called value from your component, not the word “value”. To “escape into JavaScript” from JSX, you need curly braces. Add curly braces around value in JSX like so: <code_snipet> function Square({ value }) { return <button className=\"square\">{value}</button>;} </code_snipet> For now, you should see an empty board: This is because the Board component hasn’t passed the value prop to each Square component it renders yet. To fix it you’ll add the value prop to each Square component rendered by the Board component: <code_snipet> export default function Board() { return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value=\"1\" /> <Square value=\"2\" /> <Square value=\"3\" /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value=\"4\" /> <Square value=\"5\" /> <Square value=\"6\" /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value=\"7\" /> <Square value=\"8\" /> <Square value=\"9\" /> </div> </> );} </code_snipet> Now you should see a grid of numbers again: Your updated code should look like this: App.js App.js Reset Fork function Square({ value }) { return <button className=\"square\">{value}</button>; } export default function Board() { return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value=\"1\" /> <Square value=\"2\" /> <Square value=\"3\" /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value=\"4\" /> <Square value=\"5\" /> <Square value=\"6\" /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value=\"7\" /> <Square value=\"8\" /> <Square value=\"9\" /> </div> </> ); } Show more Making'),\n",

Declare a function called handleClick inside of the Square . Then, add onClick to the props of the button JSX element returned from the Square : <code_snipet> function Square({ value }) { function handleClick() { console.log(\\'clicked!\\'); } return ( <button className=\"square\" onClick={handleClick} > {value} </button> );} </code_snipet> If you click on a square now, you should see a log saying \"clicked!\" in the Console tab at the bottom of the Browser section in CodeSandbox. Clicking the square more than once will log \"clicked!\" again. Repeated console logs with the same message will not create more lines in the console. Instead, you will see an incrementing counter next to your first \"clicked!\" log. Note If you are following this tutorial using your local development environment, you need to open your browser’s Console. For example, if you use the Chrome browser, you can view the Console with the keyboard shortcut Shift + Ctrl + J (on Windows/Linux) or Option + ⌘ + J (on macOS). As a next step, you want the Square component to “remember” that it got clicked, and fill it with an “X” mark. To “remember” things, components use state . React provides a special function called useState that you can call from your component to let it “remember” things. Let’s store the current value of the Square in state, and change it when the Square is clicked. Import useState at the top of the file. Remove the value prop from the Square component. Instead, add a new line at the start of the Square that calls useState . Have it return a state variable called value : <code_snipet> import { useState } from \\'react\\';function Square() { const [value, setValue] = useState(null); function handleClick() { //...'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='useState . Have it return a state variable called value : <code_snipet> import { useState } from \\'react\\';function Square() { const [value, setValue] = useState(null); function handleClick() { //... </code_snipet> value stores the value and setValue is a function that can be used to change the value. The null passed to useState is used as the initial value for this state variable, so value here starts off equal to null . Since the Square component no longer accepts props anymore, you’ll remove the value prop from all nine of the Square components created by the Board component: <code_snipet> // ...export default function Board() { return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square /> <Square /> <Square /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square /> <Square /> <Square /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square /> <Square /> <Square /> </div> </> );} </code_snipet> Now you’ll change Square to display an “X” when clicked. Replace the console.log(\"clicked!\"); event handler with setValue(\\'X\\'); . Now your Square component looks like this: <code_snipet> function Square() { const [value, setValue] = useState(null); function handleClick() { setValue(\\'X\\'); } return ( <button className=\"square\" onClick={handleClick} > {value} </button> );} </code_snipet> By calling this set function from an onClick handler, you’re telling React to re-render that Square whenever its <button> is clicked. After the update, the Square ’s value will be \\'X\\' , so you’ll see the “X” on the game board. Click on any Square, and “X” should show up: Each Square has its own state: the value stored in each Square is completely independent of the others. When you call a set function in a component, React automatically updates the child components inside too. After you’ve made the above changes, your code will look like this: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; function Square() { const [value, setValue] = useState(null); function handleClick() { setValue(\\'X\\'); } return ( <button'),\n",

You can find the React DevTools tab at the bottom of the browser section in CodeSandbox: To inspect a particular component on the screen, use the button in the top left corner of React DevTools: Note For local development, React DevTools is available as a Chrome , Firefox , and Edge browser extension. Install it, and the Components tab will appear in your browser Developer Tools for sites using React. Completing the game By this point, you have all the basic building blocks for your tic-tac-toe game. To have a complete game, you now need to alternate placing “X”s and “O”s on the board, and you need a way to determine a winner. Lifting state up Currently, each Square component maintains a part of the game’s state. To check for a winner in a tic-tac-toe game, the Board would need to somehow know the state of each of the 9 Square components. How would you approach that? At first, you might guess that the Board needs to “ask” each Square for that Square ’s state. Although this approach is technically possible in React, we discourage it because the code becomes difficult to understand, susceptible to bugs, and hard to refactor. Instead, the best approach is to store the game’s state in the parent Board component instead of in each Square . The Board component can tell each Square what to display by passing a prop, like you did when you passed a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='is to store the game’s state in the parent Board component instead of in each Square . The Board component can tell each Square what to display by passing a prop, like you did when you passed a number to each Square. To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child components in sync with each other and with their parent. Lifting state into a parent component is common when React components are refactored. Let’s take this opportunity to try it out. Edit the Board component so that it declares a state variable named squares that defaults to an array of 9 nulls corresponding to the 9 squares: <code_snipet> // ...export default function Board() { const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null)); return ( // ... );} </code_snipet> Array(9).fill(null) creates an array with nine elements and sets each of them to null . The useState() call around it declares a squares state variable that’s initially set to that array. Each entry in the array corresponds to the value of a square. When you fill the board in later, the squares array will look like this: <code_snipet> [\\'O\\', null, \\'X\\', \\'X\\', \\'X\\', \\'O\\', \\'O\\', null, null] </code_snipet> Now your Board component needs to pass the value prop down to each Square that it renders: <code_snipet> export default function Board() { const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null)); return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[0]} /> <Square value={squares[1]} /> <Square value={squares[2]} /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[3]} /> <Square value={squares[4]} /> <Square value={squares[5]} /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[6]} /> <Square value={squares[7]} /> <Square value={squares[8]} /> </div> </> );} </code_snipet> Next, you’ll edit the Square'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='/> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[6]} /> <Square value={squares[7]} /> <Square value={squares[8]} /> </div> </> );} </code_snipet> Next, you’ll edit the Square component to receive the value prop from the Board component. This will require removing the Square component’s own stateful tracking of value and the button’s onClick prop: <code_snipet> function Square({value}) { return <button className=\"square\">{value}</button>;} </code_snipet> At this point you should see an empty tic-tac-toe board: And your code should look like this: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; function Square({ value }) { return <button className=\"square\">{value}</button>; } export default function Board() { const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null)); return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[0]} /> <Square value={squares[1]} /> <Square value={squares[2]} /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[3]} /> <Square value={squares[4]} /> <Square value={squares[5]} /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[6]} /> <Square value={squares[7]} /> <Square value={squares[8]} /> </div> </> ); } Show more Each Square will now receive a value prop that will either be \\'X\\' , \\'O\\' , or null for empty squares. Next, you need to change what happens when a Square is clicked. The Board component now maintains which squares are filled. You’ll need to create a way for the Square to update the Board ’s state. Since state is private to a component that defines it, you cannot update the Board ’s state directly from Square . Instead, you’ll pass down a function from the Board component to the Square component, and you’ll have Square call that function when a square is clicked. You’ll start with the function that the Square component will call when it is clicked. You’ll call that function onSquareClick : <code_snipet> function Square({ value }) { return ( <button className=\"square\"'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='with the function that the Square component will call when it is clicked. You’ll call that function onSquareClick : <code_snipet> function Square({ value }) { return ( <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}> {value} </button> );} </code_snipet> Next, you’ll add the onSquareClick function to the Square component’s props: <code_snipet> function Square({ value, onSquareClick }) { return ( <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}> {value} </button> );} </code_snipet> Now you’ll connect the onSquareClick prop to a function in the Board component that you’ll name handleClick . To connect onSquareClick to handleClick you’ll pass a function to the onSquareClick prop of the first Square component: <code_snipet> export default function Board() { const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null)); return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={handleClick} /> //... );} </code_snipet> Lastly, you will define the handleClick function inside the Board component to update the squares array holding your board’s state: <code_snipet> export default function Board() { const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null)); function handleClick() { const nextSquares = squares.slice(); nextSquares[0] = \"X\"; setSquares(nextSquares); } return ( // ... )} </code_snipet> The handleClick function creates a copy of the squares array ( nextSquares ) with the JavaScript slice() Array method. Then, handleClick updates the nextSquares array to add X to the first ( [0] index) square. Calling the setSquares function lets React know the state of the component has changed. This will trigger a re-render of the components that use the squares state ( Board ) as well as its child components (the Square components that make up the board). Note JavaScript supports closures which means an inner function (e.g. handleClick ) has access to variables and functions defined in an outer function (e.g. Board ). The handleClick function can'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Note JavaScript supports closures which means an inner function (e.g. handleClick ) has access to variables and functions defined in an outer function (e.g. Board ). The handleClick function can read the squares state and call the setSquares method because they are both defined inside of the Board function. Now you can add X’s to the board… but only to the upper left square. Your handleClick function is hardcoded to update the index for the upper left square ( 0 ). Let’s update handleClick to be able to update any square. Add an argument i to the handleClick function that takes the index of the square to update: <code_snipet> export default function Board() { const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null)); function handleClick(i) { const nextSquares = squares.slice(); nextSquares[i] = \"X\"; setSquares(nextSquares); } return ( // ... )} </code_snipet> Next, you will need to pass that i to handleClick . You could try to set the onSquareClick prop of square to be handleClick(0) directly in the JSX like this, but it won’t work: <code_snipet> <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={handleClick(0)} /> </code_snipet> Here is why this doesn’t work. The handleClick(0) call will be a part of rendering the board component. Because handleClick(0) alters the state of the board component by calling setSquares , your entire board component will be re-rendered again. But this runs handleClick(0) again, leading to an infinite loop: Console Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Why didn’t this problem happen earlier? When you were passing onSquareClick={handleClick} , you were passing the handleClick function down as a prop. You were not calling it! But now you are calling that function right away—notice the parentheses in handleClick(0) —and that’s why it runs too early. You don’t want to call handleClick until the user clicks! You could fix this by creating a function like handleFirstSquareClick that calls handleClick(0)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='—and that’s why it runs too early. You don’t want to call handleClick until the user clicks! You could fix this by creating a function like handleFirstSquareClick that calls handleClick(0) , a function like handleSecondSquareClick that calls handleClick(1) , and so on. You would pass (rather than call) these functions down as props like onSquareClick={handleFirstSquareClick} . This would solve the infinite loop. However, defining nine different functions and giving each of them a name is too verbose. Instead, let’s do this: <code_snipet> export default function Board() { // ... return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} /> // ... );} </code_snipet> Notice the new () => syntax. Here, () => handleClick(0) is an arrow function, which is a shorter way to define functions. When the square is clicked, the code after the => “arrow” will run, calling handleClick(0) . Now you need to update the other eight squares to call handleClick from the arrow functions you pass. Make sure that the argument for each call of the handleClick corresponds to the index of the correct square: <code_snipet> export default function Board() { // ... return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} /> <Square value={squares[1]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(1)} /> <Square value={squares[2]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(2)} /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[3]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(3)} /> <Square value={squares[4]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(4)} /> <Square value={squares[5]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(5)} /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[6]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(6)} /> <Square value={squares[7]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(7)} /> <Square value={squares[8]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(8)} /> </div> </> );}; </code_snipet> Now you can again add X’s to any square on the board by'),\n",

This is what your code should look like: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; function Square({ value, onSquareClick }) { return ( <button className=\"square\" onClick={onSquareClick}> {value} </button> ); } export default function Board() { const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null)); function handleClick(i) { const nextSquares = squares.slice(); nextSquares[i] = \\'X\\'; setSquares(nextSquares); } return ( <> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[0]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(0)} /> <Square value={squares[1]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(1)} /> <Square value={squares[2]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(2)} /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[3]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(3)} /> <Square value={squares[4]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(4)} /> <Square value={squares[5]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(5)} /> </div> <div className=\"board-row\"> <Square value={squares[6]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(6)} /> <Square value={squares[7]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(7)} /> <Square value={squares[8]} onSquareClick={() => handleClick(8)} /> </div> </> ); } Show more Now that your state handling is in the Board component, the parent Board component passes props to the child Square components so that they can be displayed correctly. When clicking on a Square , the child Square component now asks the parent Board component to update the state of the board. When the Board ’s state changes, both the Board component and every child Square re-renders automatically. Keeping the state of all squares in the Board component will allow it to determine the winner in the future. Let’s recap what happens when'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='component and every child Square re-renders automatically. Keeping the state of all squares in the Board component will allow it to determine the winner in the future. Let’s recap what happens when a user clicks the top left square on your board to add an X to it: Clicking on the upper left square runs the function that the button received as its onClick prop from the Square . The Square component received that function as its onSquareClick prop from the Board . The Board component defined that function directly in the JSX. It calls handleClick with an argument of 0 . handleClick uses the argument ( 0 ) to update the first element of the squares array from null to X . The squares state of the Board component was updated, so the Board and all of its children re-render. This causes the value prop of the Square component with index 0 to change from null to X . In the end the user sees that the upper left square has changed from empty to having a X after clicking it. Note The DOM <button> element’s onClick attribute has a special meaning to React because it is a built-in component. For custom components like Square, the naming is up to you. You could give any name to the Square ’s onSquareClick prop or Board ’s handleClick function, and the code would work the same. In React, it’s conventional to use onSomething names for props which represent events and handleSomething for the function definitions which handle those events. Why immutability is important Note how in handleClick , you call .slice() to create a copy of the squares array instead of modifying the existing array. To explain why, we need to discuss immutability and why immutability is important to learn. There are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to mutate the data by directly changing the data’s values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes. Here is what it would look like if you mutated the squares array: <code_snipet> const'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='the data’s values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes. Here is what it would look like if you mutated the squares array: <code_snipet> const squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];squares[0] = \\'X\\';// Now `squares` is [\"X\", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null]; </code_snipet> And here is what it would look like if you changed data without mutating the squares array: <code_snipet> const squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];const nextSquares = [\\'X\\', null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];// Now `squares` is unchanged, but `nextSquares` first element is \\'X\\' rather than `null` </code_snipet> The result is the same but by not mutating (changing the underlying data) directly, you gain several benefits. Immutability makes complex features much easier to implement. Later in this tutorial, you will implement a “time travel” feature that lets you review the game’s history and “jump back” to past moves. This functionality isn’t specific to games—an ability to undo and redo certain actions is a common requirement for apps. Avoiding direct data mutation lets you keep previous versions of the data intact, and reuse them later. There is also another benefit of immutability. By default, all child components re-render automatically when the state of a parent component changes. This includes even the child components that weren’t affected by the change. Although re-rendering is not by itself noticeable to the user (you shouldn’t actively try to avoid it!), you might want to skip re-rendering a part of the tree that clearly wasn’t affected by it for performance reasons. Immutability makes it very cheap for components to compare whether their data has changed or not. You can learn more about how React chooses when to re-render a component in the memo API reference .

Taking turns It’s now time to fix a major defect in this tic-tac-toe game: the “O”s cannot be marked on the board. You’ll set the first move to be “X” by default. Let’s keep track of this by adding another piece of state to the Board component: <code_snipet> function Board() { const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true); const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null)); // ...} </code_snipet> Each time a player moves, xIsNext (a boolean) will be flipped to determine which player goes next and the game’s state will be saved. You’ll update the Board ’s handleClick function to flip the value of xIsNext : <code_snipet> export default function Board() { const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true); const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null)); function handleClick(i) { const nextSquares = squares.slice(); if (xIsNext) { nextSquares[i] = \"X\"; } else { nextSquares[i] = \"O\"; } setSquares(nextSquares); setXIsNext(!xIsNext); } return ( //... );} </code_snipet> Now, as you click on different squares, they will alternate between X and O , as they should! But wait, there’s a problem. Try clicking on the same square multiple times: The X is overwritten by an O ! While this would add a very interesting twist to the game, we’re going to stick to the original rules for now. When you mark a square with a X or an O you aren’t first checking to see if the square already has a X or O value. You can fix this by returning early . You’ll check to see if the square already has a X or an O . If the square is already filled, you will return in the handleClick function early—before it tries to update the board state. <code_snipet> function handleClick(i) { if (squares[i]) { return; } const nextSquares = squares.slice(); //...} </code_snipet> Now you can only add X ’s or O ’s to empty squares!

To do this you’ll add a helper function called calculateWinner that takes an array of 9 squares, checks for a winner and returns \\'X\\' , \\'O\\' , or null as appropriate. Don’t worry too much about the calculateWinner function; it’s not specific to React: <code_snipet> export default function Board() { //...}function calculateWinner(squares) { const lines = [ [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7],'),\n",

Let’s put it at the end so that you don’t have to scroll past it every time you edit your components. You will call calculateWinner(squares) in the Board component’s handleClick function to check if a player has won. You can perform this check at the same time you check if a user has clicked a square that already has a X or and O . We’d like to return early in both cases: <code_snipet> function handleClick(i) { if (squares[i] || calculateWinner(squares)) { return; } const nextSquares = squares.slice(); //...} </code_snipet> To let the players know when the game is over, you can display text such as “Winner: X” or “Winner: O”. To do that you’ll add a status section to the Board component. The status will display the winner if the game is over and if the game is ongoing you’ll display which player’s turn is next: <code_snipet> export default function Board() { // ... const winner = calculateWinner(squares); let status; if (winner) { status = \"Winner: \" + winner; } else { status = \"Next player: \" + (xIsNext ? \"X\" : \"O\"); } return ( <> <div className=\"status\">{status}</div> <div className=\"board-row\"> // ... )} </code_snipet> Congratulations!

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='squares[c]) { return squares[a]; } } return null; } Show more Adding time travel As a final exercise, let’s make it possible to “go back in time” to the previous moves in the game. Storing a history of moves If you mutated the squares array, implementing time travel would be very difficult. However, you used slice() to create a new copy of the squares array after every move, and treated it as immutable. This will allow you to store every past version of the squares array, and navigate between the turns that have already happened. You’ll store the past squares arrays in another array called history , which you’ll store as a new state variable. The history array represents all board states, from the first to the last move, and has a shape like this: <code_snipet> [ // Before first move [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null], // After first move [null, null, null, null, \\'X\\', null, null, null, null], // After second move [null, null, null, null, \\'X\\', null, null, null, \\'O\\'], // ...] </code_snipet> Lifting state up, again You will now write a new top-level component called Game to display a list of past moves. That’s where you will place the history state that contains the entire game history. Placing the history state into the Game component will let you remove the squares state from its child Board component. Just like you “lifted state up” from the Square component into the Board component, you will now lift it up from the Board into the top-level Game component. This gives the Game component full control over the Board ’s data and lets it instruct the Board to render previous turns from the history . First, add a Game component with export default . Have it render the Board component and some markup: <code_snipet> function Board() { // ...}export default function Game() { return ( <div className=\"game\"> <div className=\"game-board\"> <Board /> </div> <div className=\"game-info\"> <ol>{/*TODO*/}</ol> </div> </div> );} </code_snipet> Note that you are'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='function Game() { return ( <div className=\"game\"> <div className=\"game-board\"> <Board /> </div> <div className=\"game-info\"> <ol>{/*TODO*/}</ol> </div> </div> );} </code_snipet> Note that you are removing the export default keywords before the function Board() { declaration and adding them before the function Game() { declaration. This tells your index.js file to use the Game component as the top-level component instead of your Board component. The additional div s returned by the Game component are making room for the game information you’ll add to the board later. Add some state to the Game component to track which player is next and the history of moves: <code_snipet> export default function Game() { const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true); const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]); // ... </code_snipet> Notice how [Array(9).fill(null)] is an array with a single item, which itself is an array of 9 null s. To render the squares for the current move, you’ll want to read the last squares array from the history . You don’t need useState for this—you already have enough information to calculate it during rendering: <code_snipet> export default function Game() { const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true); const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]); const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1]; // ... </code_snipet> Next, create a handlePlay function inside the Game component that will be called by the Board component to update the game. Pass xIsNext , currentSquares and handlePlay as props to the Board component: <code_snipet> export default function Game() { const [xIsNext, setXIsNext] = useState(true); const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]); const currentSquares = history[history.length - 1]; function handlePlay(nextSquares) { // TODO } return ( <div className=\"game\"> <div className=\"game-board\"> <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} /> //... )} </code_snipet>'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='handlePlay(nextSquares) { // TODO } return ( <div className=\"game\"> <div className=\"game-board\"> <Board xIsNext={xIsNext} squares={currentSquares} onPlay={handlePlay} /> //... )} </code_snipet> Let’s make the Board component fully controlled by the props it receives. Change the Board component to take three props: xIsNext , squares , and a new onPlay function that Board can call with the updated squares array when a player makes a move. Next, remove the first two lines of the Board function that call useState : <code_snipet> function Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) { function handleClick(i) { //... } // ...} </code_snipet> Now replace the setSquares and setXIsNext calls in handleClick in the Board component with a single call to your new onPlay function so the Game component can update the Board when the user clicks a square: <code_snipet> function Board({ xIsNext, squares, onPlay }) { function handleClick(i) { if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) { return; } const nextSquares = squares.slice(); if (xIsNext) { nextSquares[i] = \"X\"; } else { nextSquares[i] = \"O\"; } onPlay(nextSquares); } //...} </code_snipet> The Board component is fully controlled by the props passed to it by the Game component. You need to implement the handlePlay function in the Game component to get the game working again. What should handlePlay do when called? Remember that Board used to call setSquares with an updated array; now it passes the updated squares array to onPlay . The handlePlay function needs to update Game ’s state to trigger a re-render, but you don’t have a setSquares function that you can call any more—you’re now using the history state variable to store this information. You’ll want to update history by appending the updated squares array as a new history entry. You also want to toggle xIsNext , just as Board used to do: <code_snipet> export default function Game() { //... function handlePlay(nextSquares) { setHistory([...history, nextSquares]);'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='entry. You also want to toggle xIsNext , just as Board used to do: <code_snipet> export default function Game() { //... function handlePlay(nextSquares) { setHistory([...history, nextSquares]); setXIsNext(!xIsNext); } //...} </code_snipet> Here, [...history, nextSquares] creates a new array that contains all the items in history , followed by nextSquares . (You can read the ...history spread syntax as “enumerate all the items in history ”.) For example, if history is [[null,null,null], [\"X\",null,null]] and nextSquares is [\"X\",null,\"O\"] , then the new [...history, nextSquares] array will be [[null,null,null], [\"X\",null,null], [\"X\",null,\"O\"]] . At this point, you’ve moved the state to live in the Game component, and the UI should be fully working, just as it was before the refactor.

You already have an array of history moves in state, so now you need to transform it to an array of React elements.

(In most cases, you’d need the actual array elements, but to render a list of moves you will only need indexes.) For each move in the tic-tac-toe game’s history, you create a list item <li> which contains a button <button> . The button has an onClick handler which calls a function called jumpTo (that you haven’t implemented yet). For now, you should see a list of the moves that occurred in the game and an error in the developer tools console. Let’s discuss what the “key” error means. Picking a key When you render a list, React stores some information about each rendered list item. When you update a list, React needs to determine what has changed. You could have added, removed, re-arranged, or updated the list’s items. Imagine transitioning from <code_snipet> <li>Alexa: 7 tasks left</li><li>Ben: 5 tasks left</li> </code_snipet> to <code_snipet> <li>Ben: 9 tasks left</li><li>Claudia: 8 tasks left</li><li>Alexa: 5 tasks left</li> </code_snipet> In addition to the updated counts, a human reading this would probably say that you swapped Alexa and Ben’s ordering and inserted Claudia between Alexa and Ben. However, React is a computer program and does not know what you intended, so you need to specify a key property for each list item to differentiate each list item from its siblings. If your data was from a database, Alexa, Ben, and Claudia’s database IDs could be used as keys. <code_snipet> <li key={user.id}> {user.name}: {user.taskCount} tasks left</li> </code_snipet> When a list is re-rendered,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='a database, Alexa, Ben, and Claudia’s database IDs could be used as keys. <code_snipet> <li key={user.id}> {user.name}: {user.taskCount} tasks left</li> </code_snipet> When a list is re-rendered, React takes each list item’s key and searches the previous list’s items for a matching key. If the current list has a key that didn’t exist before, React creates a component. If the current list is missing a key that existed in the previous list, React destroys the previous component. If two keys match, the corresponding component is moved. Keys tell React about the identity of each component, which allows React to maintain state between re-renders. If a component’s key changes, the component will be destroyed and re-created with a new state. key is a special and reserved property in React. When an element is created, React extracts the key property and stores the key directly on the returned element. Even though key may look like it is passed as props, React automatically uses key to decide which components to update. There’s no way for a component to ask what key its parent specified. It’s strongly recommended that you assign proper keys whenever you build dynamic lists. If you don’t have an appropriate key, you may want to consider restructuring your data so that you do. If no key is specified, React will report an error and use the array index as a key by default. Using the array index as a key is problematic when trying to re-order a list’s items or inserting/removing list items. Explicitly passing key={i} silences the error but has the same problems as array indices and is not recommended in most cases. Keys do not need to be globally unique; they only need to be unique between components and their siblings. Implementing time travel In the tic-tac-toe game’s history, each past move has a unique ID associated with it: it’s the sequential number of the move. Moves will never be re-ordered, deleted, or inserted in the middle, so it’s safe to use the move index as a key.'),\n",

In other words, if you know the value of currentMove , then you can always figure out what xIsNext should be. There’s no reason for you to store both of these in state. In fact, always try to avoid redundant state. Simplifying what you store in state reduces bugs and makes your code easier to understand. Change Game so that it doesn’t store xIsNext as a separate state variable and instead figures it out based on the currentMove : <code_snipet> export default function Game() { const [history, setHistory] = useState([Array(9).fill(null)]); const [currentMove, setCurrentMove] = useState(0); const xIsNext = currentMove % 2 === 0; const currentSquares = history[currentMove]; function handlePlay(nextSquares) { const nextHistory = [...history.slice(0, currentMove + 1), nextSquares]; setHistory(nextHistory); setCurrentMove(nextHistory.length - 1); } function jumpTo(nextMove) { setCurrentMove(nextMove); } // ...} </code_snipet> You no longer need the xIsNext state declaration or the calls to setXIsNext .

Learn React Quick Start Thinking in React React can change how you think about the designs you look at and the apps you build. When you build a user interface with React, you will first break it apart into pieces called components . Then, you will describe the different visual states for each of your components. Finally, you will connect your components together so that the data flows through them. In this tutorial, we’ll guide you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table with React. Start with the mockup Imagine that you already have a JSON API and a mockup from a designer. The JSON API returns some data that looks like this: <code_snipet> [ { category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Apple\"'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='that you already have a JSON API and a mockup from a designer. The JSON API returns some data that looks like this: <code_snipet> [ { category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Apple\" }, { category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Dragonfruit\" }, { category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$2\", stocked: false, name: \"Passionfruit\" }, { category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$2\", stocked: true, name: \"Spinach\" }, { category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$4\", stocked: false, name: \"Pumpkin\" }, { category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Peas\" }] </code_snipet> The mockup looks like this: To implement a UI in React, you will usually follow the same five steps. Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy Start by drawing boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mockup and naming them. If you work with a designer, they may have already named these components in their design tool. Ask them! Depending on your background, you can think about splitting up a design into components in different ways: Programming —use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle , that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents. CSS —consider what you would make class selectors for. (However, components are a bit less granular.) Design —consider how you would organize the design’s layers. If your JSON is well-structured, you’ll often find that it naturally maps to the component structure of your UI. That’s because UI and data models often have the same information architecture—that is, the same shape. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model. There are five components on this screen: FilterableProductTable (grey) contains the entire app. SearchBar (blue) receives the user input. ProductTable (lavender) displays and filters the list according'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='are five components on this screen: FilterableProductTable (grey) contains the entire app. SearchBar (blue) receives the user input. ProductTable (lavender) displays and filters the list according to the user input. ProductCategoryRow (green) displays a heading for each category. ProductRow (yellow) displays a row for each product. If you look at ProductTable (lavender), you’ll see that the table header (containing the “Name” and “Price” labels) isn’t its own component. This is a matter of preference, and you could go either way. For this example, it is a part of ProductTable because it appears inside the ProductTable ’s list. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if you add sorting), you can move it into its own ProductTableHeader component. Now that you’ve identified the components in the mockup, arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mockup should appear as a child in the hierarchy: FilterableProductTable SearchBar ProductTable ProductCategoryRow ProductRow Step 2: Build a static version in React Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The most straightforward approach is to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity… yet! It’s often easier to build the static version first and add interactivity later. Building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, but adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. Props are a way of passing data from parent to child. (If you’re familiar with the concept of state , don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.) You can either build “top down”'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.) You can either build “top down” by starting with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (like FilterableProductTable ) or “bottom up” by working from components lower down (like ProductRow ). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up. App.js App.js Reset Fork function ProductCategoryRow({ category }) { return ( <tr> <th colSpan=\"2\"> {category} </th> </tr> ); } function ProductRow({ product }) { const name = product.stocked ? product.name : <span style={{ color: \\'red\\' }}> {product.name} </span>; return ( <tr> <td>{name}</td> <td>{product.price}</td> </tr> ); } function ProductTable({ products }) { const rows = []; let lastCategory = null; products.forEach((product) => { if (product.category !== lastCategory) { rows.push( <ProductCategoryRow category={product.category} key={product.category} /> ); } rows.push( <ProductRow product={product} key={product.name} /> ); lastCategory = product.category; }); return ( <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Price</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody>{rows}</tbody> </table> ); } function SearchBar() { return ( <form> <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Search...\" /> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" /> {\\' \\'} Only show products in stock </label> </form> ); } function FilterableProductTable({ products }) { return ( <div> <SearchBar /> <ProductTable products={products} /> </div> ); } const PRODUCTS = [ {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Apple\"}, {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name: \"Dragonfruit\"}, {category: \"Fruits\", price: \"$2\", stocked: false, name: \"Passionfruit\"}, {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$2\", stocked: true, name: \"Spinach\"}, {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$4\", stocked: false, name: \"Pumpkin\"}, {category: \"Vegetables\", price: \"$1\", stocked: true, name:'),\n",

After building your components, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. Because this is a static app, the components will only return JSX. The component at the top of the hierarchy ( FilterableProductTable ) will take your data model as a prop. This is called one-way data flow because the data flows down from the top-level component to the ones at the bottom of the tree. Pitfall At this point, you should not be using any state values. That’s for the next step! Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state To make the UI interactive, you need to let users change your underlying data model. You will use state for this. Think of state as the minimal set of changing data that your app needs to remember. The most important principle for structuring state is to keep it DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else on-demand. For example, if you’re building a shopping list, you can store the items as an array in state. If you want to also display the number of items in the list, don’t store the number of items as another state value—instead, read the length of your array. Now think of all of the pieces of data in this example application: The original list of products The search text the user has entered The value of the checkbox The filtered list of products Which of these are state? Identify the ones that are not: Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state. Can you compute it based on'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='these are state? Identify the ones that are not: Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state. Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state! What’s left is probably state. Let’s go through them one by one again: The original list of products is passed in as props, so it’s not state. The search text seems to be state since it changes over time and can’t be computed from anything. The value of the checkbox seems to be state since it changes over time and can’t be computed from anything. The filtered list of products isn’t state because it can be computed by taking the original list of products and filtering it according to the search text and value of the checkbox. This means only the search text and the value of the checkbox are state! Nicely done! Deep Dive Props vs State Show Details There are two types of “model” data in React: props and state. The two are very different: Props are like arguments you pass to a function. They let a parent component pass data to a child component and customize its appearance. For example, a Form can pass a color prop to a Button . State is like a component’s memory. It lets a component keep track of some information and change it in response to interactions. For example, a Button might keep track of isHovered state. Props and state are different, but they work together. A parent component will often keep some information in state (so that it can change it), and pass it down to child components as their props. It’s okay if the difference still feels fuzzy on the first read. It takes a bit of practice for it to really stick! Step 4: Identify where your state should live After identifying your app’s minimal state data, you need to identify which component is responsible for changing this state, or owns the state. Remember: React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='state data, you need to identify which component is responsible for changing this state, or owns the state. Remember: React uses one-way data flow, passing data down the component hierarchy from parent to child component. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This can be challenging if you’re new to this concept, but you can figure it out by following these steps! For each piece of state in your application: Identify every component that renders something based on that state. Find their closest common parent component—a component above them all in the hierarchy. Decide where the state should live: Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent. You can also put the state into some component above their common parent. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component. In the previous step, you found two pieces of state in this application: the search input text, and the value of the checkbox. In this example, they always appear together, so it makes sense to put them into the same place. Now let’s run through our strategy for them: Identify components that use state: ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on that state (search text and checkbox value). SearchBar needs to display that state (search text and checkbox value). Find their common parent: The first parent component both components share is FilterableProductTable . Decide where the state lives : We’ll keep the filter text and checked state values in FilterableProductTable . So the state values will live in FilterableProductTable . Add state to the component with the useState() Hook. Hooks are special functions that let you “hook into” React. Add two state variables at the top of FilterableProductTable and specify their initial state: <code_snipet> function FilterableProductTable({ products }) { const'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Add inverse data flow Currently your app renders correctly with props and state flowing down the hierarchy. But to change the state according to user input, you will need to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable . React makes this data flow explicit, but it requires a little more typing than two-way data binding. If you try to type or check the box in the example above, you’ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional. By writing <input value={filterText} /> , you’ve set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the filterText state passed in from FilterableProductTable . Since filterText state is never set, the input never changes. You want to make it so whenever the user changes the form inputs, the state updates to reflect those changes. The state is owned by FilterableProductTable , so only it can call setFilterText and setInStockOnly . To let SearchBar update the FilterableProductTable ’s state, you need to pass these functions down to SearchBar : <code_snipet> function FilterableProductTable({ products }) { const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState(\\'\\'); const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false); return ( <div> <SearchBar filterText={filterText} inStockOnly={inStockOnly} onFilterTextChange={setFilterText} onInStockOnlyChange={setInStockOnly} /> </code_snipet> Inside the SearchBar , you will add the onChange event handlers and set the parent state from them: <code_snipet> function SearchBar({ filterText, inStockOnly, onFilterTextChange, onInStockOnlyChange}) { return ( <form> <input type=\"text\" value={filterText} placeholder=\"Search...\" onChange={(e) => onFilterTextChange(e.target.value)} /> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={inStockOnly} onChange={(e) => onInStockOnlyChange(e.target.checked)} </code_snipet> Now the application fully works!

You can use React without a framework, however we’ve found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, routing, data fetching, and generating HTML.

Show Details You can definitely use React without a framework—that’s how you’d use React for a part of your page. However, if you’re building a new app or a site fully with React, we recommend using a framework. Here’s why. Even if you don’t need routing or data fetching at first, you’ll likely want to add some libraries for them. As your JavaScript bundle grows with every new feature, you might have to figure out how to split code for every route individually. As your data fetching needs get more complex, you are likely to encounter server-client network waterfalls that make your app feel very slow. As your audience includes more users with poor network conditions and low-end devices, you might need to generate HTML from your components to display content early—either on the server, or during the build time. Changing your setup to run some of your code on the server or during the build can be very tricky. These problems are not React-specific. This is why Svelte has SvelteKit, Vue has Nuxt, and so on. To solve these problems on your own, you’ll need to integrate your bundler with your router and with your data fetching library. It’s not hard to get an initial setup working, but there are a lot of subtleties involved in making an app that loads quickly even as it grows over time. You’ll want to send down the minimal amount of app code but do so in a single client–server roundtrip, in parallel with any data required for the page. You’ll likely want the page to be interactive before your JavaScript code even runs, to support progressive enhancement. You may want to generate a folder of fully static HTML files for your marketing pages that can be hosted anywhere and still work with JavaScript disabled.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='JavaScript disabled. Building these capabilities yourself takes real work. React frameworks on this page solve problems like these by default, with no extra work from your side. They let you start very lean and then scale your app with your needs. Each React framework has a community, so finding answers to questions and upgrading tooling is easier. Frameworks also give structure to your code, helping you and others retain context and skills between different projects. Conversely, with a custom setup it’s easier to get stuck on unsupported dependency versions, and you’ll essentially end up creating your own framework—albeit one with no community or upgrade path (and if it’s anything like the ones we’ve made in the past, more haphazardly designed). If your app has unusual constraints not served well by these frameworks, or you prefer to solve these problems yourself, you can roll your own custom setup with React. Grab react and react-dom from npm, set up your custom build process with a bundler like Vite or Parcel , and add other tools as you need them for routing, static generation or server-side rendering, and more.

Bleeding-edge React frameworks As we’ve explored how to continue improving React, we realized that integrating React more closely with frameworks (specifically, with routing, bundling, and server technologies) is our biggest opportunity to help React users build better apps. The Next.js team has agreed to collaborate with us in researching, developing, integrating, and testing framework-agnostic bleeding-edge React features like React Server Components. These features are getting closer to being production-ready every day, and we’ve been in talks with other bundler and framework developers about integrating them. Our hope is that in a year or two, all frameworks listed on this page will have full support for these features. (If you’re a framework author interested in partnering with us to experiment with these features, please let us know!) Next.js (App Router) Next.js’s App Router is a redesign of the Next.js APIs aiming to fulfill the React team’s full-stack architecture vision.

Add React to your existing stack, and render interactive React components anywhere. Note You need to install Node.js for local development.

Here’s how we recommend to set it up: Build the React part of your app using one of the React-based frameworks . Specify /some-app as the base path in your framework’s configuration (here’s how: Next.js , Gatsby ). Configure your server or a proxy so that all requests under /some-app/ are handled by your React app. This ensures the React part of your app can benefit from the best practices baked into those frameworks. Many React-based frameworks are full-stack and let your React app take advantage of the server. However, you can use the same approach even if you can’t or don’t want to run JavaScript on the server. In that case, serve the HTML/CSS/JS export ( next export output for Next.js, default for Gatsby) at /some-app/ instead. Using React for a part of your existing page Let’s say you have an existing page built with another technology (either a server one like Rails, or a client one like Backbone), and you want to render interactive React components somewhere on that page. That’s a common way to integrate React—in fact, it’s how most React usage looked at Meta for many years! You can do this in two steps: Set up a JavaScript environment that lets you use the JSX syntax , split your code into modules with the import / export syntax, and use packages (for example, React) from the npm package registry. Render your React components where you want to see them on the page. The exact approach depends on your existing page setup, so let’s walk through some details.

It also lets you use all the wonderful packages published by other developers on the npm registry—including React itself! How you do this depends on your existing setup: If your app is already split into files that use import statements, try to use the setup you already have. Check whether writing <div /> in your JS code causes a syntax error. If it causes a syntax error, you might need to transform your JavaScript code with Babel , and enable the Babel React preset to use JSX. If your app doesn’t have an existing setup for compiling JavaScript modules, set it up with Vite . The Vite community maintains many integrations with backend frameworks , including Rails, Django, and Laravel. If your backend framework is not listed, follow this guide to manually integrate Vite builds with your backend. To check whether your setup works, run this command in your project folder: Terminal Copy <code_snipet> npm install react react-dom </code_snipet> Then add these lines of code at the top of your main JavaScript file (it might be called index.js or main.js ): index.js index.js Reset Fork import { createRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\'; // Clear the existing HTML content document.body.innerHTML = \\'<div id=\"app\"></div>\\'; // Render your React component instead const root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\\'app\\')); root.render(<h1>Hello, world</h1>); If the entire content of your page was replaced by a “Hello, world!”, everything worked! Keep reading. Note Integrating a modular JavaScript environment into an existing project for the first time can feel intimidating, but it’s worth it! If you get stuck, try our community resources or the Vite Chat . Step 2: Render React components anywhere on the page In the previous step, you put this code at the top of your main file: <code_snipet> import { createRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\';// Clear the existing HTML contentdocument.body.innerHTML = \\'<div id=\"app\"></div>\\';//'),\n",

Delete this code. Instead, you probably want to render your React components in specific places in your HTML. Open your HTML page (or the server templates that generate it) and add a unique id attribute to any tag, for example: <code_snipet> <!-- ... somewhere in your html ... --><nav id=\"navigation\"></nav><!-- ... more html ... --> </code_snipet> This lets you find that HTML element with document.getElementById and pass it to createRoot so that you can render your own React component inside: index.js index.html index.js Reset Fork import { createRoot } from \\'react-dom/client\\'; function NavigationBar() { // TODO: Actually implement a navigation bar return <h1>Hello from React!</h1>; } const domNode = document.getElementById(\\'navigation\\'); const root = createRoot(domNode); root.render(<NavigationBar />); Notice how the original HTML content from index.html is preserved, but your own NavigationBar React component now appears inside the <nav id=\"navigation\"> from your HTML. Read the createRoot usage documentation to learn more about rendering React components inside an existing HTML page. When you adopt React in an existing project, it’s common to start with small interactive components (like buttons), and then gradually keep “moving upwards” until eventually your entire page is built with React.

Other popular text editors used in the React community include: WebStorm is an integrated development environment designed specifically for JavaScript. Sublime Text has support for JSX and TypeScript, syntax highlighting and autocomplete built in. Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as “vi” with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X. Recommended text editor features Some editors come with these features built in, but others might require adding an extension. Check to see what support your editor of choice provides to be sure! Linting Code linters find problems in your code as you write, helping you fix them early. ESLint is a popular, open source linter for JavaScript. Install ESLint with the recommended configuration for React (be sure you have Node installed! ) Integrate ESLint in VSCode with the official extension Make sure that you’ve enabled all the eslint-plugin-react-hooks rules for your project. They are essential and catch the most severe bugs early. The recommended eslint-config-react-app preset already includes them. Formatting The last thing you want to do when sharing your code with another contributor is get into a discussion about tabs vs spaces ! Fortunately, Prettier will clean up your code by reformatting it to conform to preset, configurable rules. Run Prettier, and all your tabs will be converted to spaces—and your indentation, quotes, etc will also all be changed to conform to the configuration. In the ideal setup, Prettier will run when you save your file, quickly making these edits for you. You can install the Prettier extension in VSCode by following these steps: Launch VS Code Use Quick Open (press Ctrl/Cmd+P) Paste in ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode Press Enter Formatting on save Ideally, you should format your code on every save.

If your ESLint preset has formatting rules, they may conflict with Prettier. We recommend disabling all formatting rules in your ESLint preset using eslint-config-prettier so that ESLint is only used for catching logical mistakes. If you want to enforce that files are formatted before a pull request is merged, use prettier --check for your continuous integration.

Learn React Installation Using TypeScript TypeScript is a popular way to add type definitions to JavaScript codebases. Out of the box, TypeScript supports JSX and you can get full React Web support by adding @types/react and @types/react-dom to your project. You will learn TypeScript with React Components Examples of typing with Hooks Common types from @types/react Further learning locations Installation All production-grade React frameworks offer support for using TypeScript.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Remix Gatsby Expo Adding TypeScript to an existing React project To install the latest version of React’s type definitions: Terminal Copy <code_snipet> npm install @types/react @types/react-dom </code_snipet> The following compiler options need to be set in your tsconfig.json : dom must be included in lib (Note: If no lib option is specified, dom is included by default). jsx must be set to one of the valid options. preserve should suffice for most applications. If you’re publishing a library, consult the jsx documentation on what value to choose. TypeScript with React Components Note Every file containing JSX must use the .tsx file extension. This is a TypeScript-specific extension that tells TypeScript that this file contains JSX. Writing TypeScript with React is very similar to writing JavaScript with React. The key difference when working with a component is that you can provide types for your component’s props. These types can be used for correctness checking and providing inline documentation in editors. Taking the MyButton component from the Quick Start guide, we can add a type describing the title for the button: App.tsx App.tsx Reset Fork TypeScript Playground function MyButton({ title }: { title: string }) { return ( <button>{title}</button> ); } export default function MyApp() { return ( <div> <h1>Welcome to my app</h1> <MyButton title=\"I\\'m a button\" /> </div> ); } Note These sandboxes can handle TypeScript code, but they do not run the type-checker. This means you can amend the TypeScript sandboxes to learn, but you won’t get any type errors or warnings. To get type-checking, you can use the TypeScript Playground or use a more fully-featured online sandbox. This inline syntax is the simplest way to provide types for a component, though once you start to have a few fields to describe it can become unwieldy. Instead, you can use an interface or type to describe the component’s props: App.tsx App.tsx Reset Fork TypeScript Playground interface MyButtonProps'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='a few fields to describe it can become unwieldy. Instead, you can use an interface or type to describe the component’s props: App.tsx App.tsx Reset Fork TypeScript Playground interface MyButtonProps { /** The text to display inside the button */ title: string; /** Whether the button can be interacted with */ disabled: boolean; } function MyButton({ title, disabled }: MyButtonProps) { return ( <button disabled={disabled}>{title}</button> ); } export default function MyApp() { return ( <div> <h1>Welcome to my app</h1> <MyButton title=\"I\\'m a disabled button\" disabled={true}/> </div> ); } Show more The type describing your component’s props can be as simple or as complex as you need, though they should be an object type described with either a type or interface . You can learn about how TypeScript describes objects in Object Types but you may also be interested in using Union Types to describe a prop that can be one of a few different types and the Creating Types from Types guide for more advanced use cases. Example Hooks The type definitions from @types/react include types for the built-in Hooks, so you can use them in your components without any additional setup. They are built to take into account the code you write in your component, so you will get inferred types a lot of the time and ideally do not need to handle the minutiae of providing the types. However, we can look at a few examples of how to provide types for Hooks. useState The useState Hook will re-use the value passed in as the initial state to determine what the type of the value should be. For example: <code_snipet> // Infer the type as \"boolean\"const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false); </code_snipet> This will assign the type of boolean to enabled , and setEnabled will be a function accepting either a boolean argument, or a function that returns a boolean . If you want to explicitly provide a type for the state, you can do so by providing a type argument to the useState call: <code_snipet> //'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='a boolean argument, or a function that returns a boolean . If you want to explicitly provide a type for the state, you can do so by providing a type argument to the useState call: <code_snipet> // Explicitly set the type to \"boolean\"const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState<boolean>(false); </code_snipet> This isn’t very useful in this case, but a common case where you may want to provide a type is when you have a union type. For example, status here can be one of a few different strings: <code_snipet> type Status = \"idle\" | \"loading\" | \"success\" | \"error\";const [status, setStatus] = useState<Status>(\"idle\"); </code_snipet> Or, as recommended in Principles for structuring state , you can group related state as an object and describe the different possibilities via object types: <code_snipet> type RequestState = | { status: \\'idle\\' } | { status: \\'loading\\' } | { status: \\'success\\', data: any } | { status: \\'error\\', error: Error };const [requestState, setRequestState] = useState<RequestState>({ status: \\'idle\\' }); </code_snipet> useReducer The useReducer Hook is a more complex Hook that takes a reducer function and an initial state. The types for the reducer function are inferred from the initial state. You can optionally provide a type argument to the useReducer call to provide a type for the state, but it is often better to set the type on the initial state instead: App.tsx App.tsx Reset Fork TypeScript Playground import {useReducer} from \\'react\\'; interface State { count: number }; type CounterAction = | { type: \"reset\" } | { type: \"setCount\"; value: State[\"count\"] } const initialState: State = { count: 0 }; function stateReducer(state: State, action: CounterAction): State { switch (action.type) { case \"reset\": return initialState; case \"setCount\": return { ...state, count: action.value }; default: throw new Error(\"Unknown action\"); } } export default function App() { const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(stateReducer, initialState); const addFive = () => dispatch({ type:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='}; default: throw new Error(\"Unknown action\"); } } export default function App() { const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(stateReducer, initialState); const addFive = () => dispatch({ type: \"setCount\", value: state.count + 5 }); const reset = () => dispatch({ type: \"reset\" }); return ( <div> <h1>Welcome to my counter</h1> <p>Count: {state.count}</p> <button onClick={addFive}>Add 5</button> <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button> </div> ); } Show more We are using TypeScript in a few key places: interface State describes the shape of the reducer’s state. type CounterAction describes the different actions which can be dispatched to the reducer. const initialState: State provides a type for the initial state, and also the type which is used by useReducer by default. stateReducer(state: State, action: CounterAction): State sets the types for the reducer function’s arguments and return value. A more explicit alternative to setting the type on initialState is to provide a type argument to useReducer : <code_snipet> import { stateReducer, State } from \\'./your-reducer-implementation\\';const initialState = { count: 0 };export default function App() { const [state, dispatch] = useReducer<State>(stateReducer, initialState);} </code_snipet> useContext The useContext Hook is a technique for passing data down the component tree without having to pass props through components. It is used by creating a provider component and often by creating a Hook to consume the value in a child component. The type of the value provided by the context is inferred from the value passed to the createContext call: App.tsx App.tsx Reset Fork TypeScript Playground import { createContext, useContext, useState } from \\'react\\'; type Theme = \"light\" | \"dark\" | \"system\"; const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme>(\"system\"); const useGetTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext); export default function MyApp() { const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(\\'light\\'); return ( <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='const useGetTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext); export default function MyApp() { const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(\\'light\\'); return ( <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}> <MyComponent /> </ThemeContext.Provider> ) } function MyComponent() { const theme = useGetTheme(); return ( <div> <p>Current theme: {theme}</p> </div> ) } Show more This technique works when you have a default value which makes sense - but there are occasionally cases when you do not, and in those cases null can feel reasonable as a default value. However, to allow the type-system to understand your code, you need to explicitly set ContextShape | null on the createContext . This causes the issue that you need to eliminate the | null in the type for context consumers. Our recommendation is to have the Hook do a runtime check for it’s existence and throw an error when not present: <code_snipet> import { createContext, useContext, useState, useMemo } from \\'react\\';// This is a simpler example, but you can imagine a more complex object heretype ComplexObject = { kind: string};// The context is created with `| null` in the type, to accurately reflect the default value.const Context = createContext<ComplexObject | null>(null);// The `| null` will be removed via the check in the Hook.const useGetComplexObject = () => { const object = useContext(Context); if (!object) { throw new Error(\"useGetComplexObject must be used within a Provider\") } return object;}export default function MyApp() { const object = useMemo(() => ({ kind: \"complex\" }), []); return ( <Context.Provider value={object}> <MyComponent /> </Context.Provider> )}function MyComponent() { const object = useGetComplexObject(); return ( <div> <p>Current object: {object.kind}</p> </div> )} </code_snipet> useMemo The useMemo Hooks will create/re-access a memorized value from a function call, re-running the function only when dependencies passed as the 2nd parameter are changed. The result of calling the Hook is inferred from the return'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='a memorized value from a function call, re-running the function only when dependencies passed as the 2nd parameter are changed. The result of calling the Hook is inferred from the return value from the function in the first parameter. You can be more explicit by providing a type argument to the Hook. <code_snipet> // The type of visibleTodos is inferred from the return value of filterTodosconst visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]); </code_snipet> useCallback The useCallback provide a stable reference to a function as long as the dependencies passed into the second parameter are the same. Like useMemo , the function’s type is inferred from the return value of the function in the first parameter, and you can be more explicit by providing a type argument to the Hook. <code_snipet> const handleClick = useCallback(() => { // ...}, [todos]); </code_snipet> When working in TypeScript strict mode useCallback requires adding types for the parameters in your callback. This is because the type of the callback is inferred from the return value of the function, and without parameters the type cannot be fully understood. Depending on your code-style preferences, you could use the *EventHandler functions from the React types to provide the type for the event handler at the same time as defining the callback: <code_snipet> import { useState, useCallback } from \\'react\\';export default function Form() { const [value, setValue] = useState(\"Change me\"); const handleChange = useCallback<React.ChangeEventHandler<HTMLInputElement>>((event) => { setValue(event.currentTarget.value); }, [setValue]) return ( <> <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} /> <p>Value: {value}</p> </> );} </code_snipet> Useful Types There is quite an expansive set of types which come from the @types/react package, it is worth a read when you feel comfortable with how React and TypeScript interact.

DOM Events When working with DOM events in React, the type of the event can often be inferred from the event handler. However, when you want to extract a function to be passed to an event handler, you will need to explicitly set the type of the event. App.tsx App.tsx Reset Fork TypeScript Playground import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function Form() { const [value, setValue] = useState(\"Change me\"); function handleChange(event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) { setValue(event.currentTarget.value); } return ( <> <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} /> <p>Value: {value}</p> </> ); } Show more There are many types of events provided in the React types - the full list can be found here which is based on the most popular events from the DOM . When determining the type you are looking for you can first look at the hover information for the event handler you are using, which will show the type of the event. If you need to use an event that is not included in this list, you can use the React.SyntheticEvent type, which is the base type for all events. Children There are two common paths to describing the children of a component. The first is to use the React.ReactNode type, which is a union of all the possible types that can be passed as children in JSX: <code_snipet> interface ModalRendererProps { title: string; children: React.ReactNode;} </code_snipet> This is a very broad definition of children. The second is to use the React.ReactElement type, which is only JSX elements and not JavaScript primitives like strings or numbers: <code_snipet> interface ModalRendererProps { title: string; children: React.ReactElement;} </code_snipet> Note, that you cannot use TypeScript to describe that the children are a certain type of JSX'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='<code_snipet> interface ModalRendererProps { title: string; children: React.ReactElement;} </code_snipet> Note, that you cannot use TypeScript to describe that the children are a certain type of JSX elements, so you cannot use the type-system to describe a component which only accepts <li> children. You can see an example of both React.ReactNode and React.ReactElement with the type-checker in this TypeScript playground . Style Props When using inline styles in React, you can use React.CSSProperties to describe the object passed to the style prop. This type is a union of all the possible CSS properties, and is a good way to ensure you are passing valid CSS properties to the style prop, and to get auto-complete in your editor. <code_snipet> interface MyComponentProps { style: React.CSSProperties;} </code_snipet> Further learning This guide has covered the basics of using TypeScript with React, but there is a lot more to learn. Individual API pages on the docs may contain more in-depth documentation on how to use them with TypeScript. We recommend the following resources: The TypeScript handbook is the official documentation for TypeScript, and covers most key language features. The TypeScript release notes cover new features in depth. React TypeScript Cheatsheet is a community-maintained cheatsheet for using TypeScript with React, covering a lot of useful edge cases and providing more breadth than this document.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='the community. While it has been used in production at companies like Meta, rolling out the compiler to production for your app will depend on the health of your codebase and how well you’ve followed the Rules of React . The latest Beta release can be found with the @beta tag, and daily experimental releases with @experimental . React Compiler is a new compiler that we’ve open sourced to get early feedback from the community. It is a build-time only tool that automatically optimizes your React app. It works with plain JavaScript, and understands the Rules of React , so you don’t need to rewrite any code to use it. The compiler also includes an ESLint plugin that surfaces the analysis from the compiler right in your editor. We strongly recommend everyone use the linter today. The linter does not require that you have the compiler installed, so you can use it even if you are not ready to try out the compiler. The compiler is currently released as beta , and is available to try out on React 17+ apps and libraries. To install the Beta: Terminal Copy <code_snipet> npm install -D   </code_snipet> Or, if you’re using Yarn: Terminal Copy <code_snipet> yarn add -D   </code_snipet> If you are not using React 19 yet, please see the section below for further instructions. What does the compiler do? In order to optimize applications, React Compiler automatically memoizes your code. You may be familiar today with memoization through APIs such as useMemo , useCallback , and React.memo . With these APIs you can tell React that certain parts of your application don’t need to recompute if their inputs haven’t changed, reducing work on updates. While powerful, it’s easy to forget to apply memoization or apply them incorrectly. This can lead to inefficient updates as React has to check parts of your UI that don’t have any meaningful changes. The compiler uses its knowledge of JavaScript and React’s rules to automatically memoize values or groups of values within your components and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='parts of your UI that don’t have any meaningful changes. The compiler uses its knowledge of JavaScript and React’s rules to automatically memoize values or groups of values within your components and hooks. If it detects breakages of the rules, it will automatically skip over just those components or hooks, and continue safely compiling other code. Note React Compiler can statically detect when Rules of React are broken, and safely opt-out of optimizing just the affected components or hooks. It is not necessary for the compiler to optimize 100% of your codebase. If your codebase is already very well-memoized, you might not expect to see major performance improvements with the compiler. However, in practice memoizing the correct dependencies that cause performance issues is tricky to get right by hand. Deep Dive What kind of memoization does React Compiler add? Show Details The initial release of React Compiler is primarily focused on improving update performance (re-rendering existing components), so it focuses on these two use cases: Skipping cascading re-rendering of components Re-rendering <Parent /> causes many components in its component tree to re-render, even though only <Parent /> has changed Skipping expensive calculations from outside of React For example, calling expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects() inside of your component or hook that needs that data Optimizing Re-renders React lets you express your UI as a function of their current state (more concretely: their props, state, and context). In its current implementation, when a component’s state changes, React will re-render that component and all of its children — unless you have applied some form of manual memoization with useMemo() , useCallback() , or React.memo() . For example, in the following example, <MessageButton> will re-render whenever <FriendList> ’s state changes: <code_snipet> function FriendList({ friends }) { const onlineCount = useFriendOnlineCount(); if (friends.length ==='),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='example, <MessageButton> will re-render whenever <FriendList> ’s state changes: <code_snipet> function FriendList({ friends }) { const onlineCount = useFriendOnlineCount(); if (friends.length === 0) { return <NoFriends />; } return ( <div> <span>{onlineCount} online</span> {friends.map((friend) => ( <FriendListCard key={friend.id} friend={friend} /> ))} <MessageButton /> </div> );} </code_snipet> See this example in the React Compiler Playground React Compiler automatically applies the equivalent of manual memoization, ensuring that only the relevant parts of an app re-render as state changes, which is sometimes referred to as “fine-grained reactivity”. In the above example, React Compiler determines that the return value of <FriendListCard /> can be reused even as friends changes, and can avoid recreating this JSX and avoid re-rendering <MessageButton> as the count changes. Expensive calculations also get memoized The compiler can also automatically memoize for expensive calculations used during rendering: <code_snipet> // **Not** memoized by React Compiler, since this is not a component or hookfunction expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects() { /* ... */ }// Memoized by React Compiler since this is a componentfunction TableContainer({ items }) { // This function call would be memoized: const data = expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects(items); // ...} </code_snipet> See this example in the React Compiler Playground However, if expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects is truly an expensive function, you may want to consider implementing its own memoization outside of React, because: React Compiler only memoizes React components and hooks, not every function React Compiler’s memoization is not shared across multiple components or hooks So if expensivelyProcessAReallyLargeArrayOfObjects was used in many different components, even if the same exact items were passed down, that expensive calculation would be run repeatedly. We recommend profiling'),\n",

We recommend profiling first to see if it really is that expensive before making code more complicated. Should I try out the compiler? Please note that the compiler is still in Beta and has many rough edges. While it has been used in production at companies like Meta, rolling out the compiler to production for your app will depend on the health of your codebase and how well you’ve followed the Rules of React . You don’t have to rush into using the compiler now. It’s okay to wait until it reaches a stable release before adopting it. However, we do appreciate trying it out in small experiments in your apps so that you can provide feedback to us to help make the compiler better. Getting Started In addition to these docs, we recommend checking the React Compiler Working Group for additional information and discussion about the compiler. Installing eslint-plugin-react-compiler React Compiler also powers an ESLint plugin. The ESLint plugin can be used independently of the compiler, meaning you can use the ESLint plugin even if you don’t use the compiler. Terminal Copy <code_snipet> npm install -D  </code_snipet> Then, add it to your ESLint config: <code_snipet> import reactCompiler from 'eslint-plugin-react-compiler'export default [ { plugins: { 'react-compiler': reactCompiler, }, rules: { 'react-compiler/react-compiler': 'error', }, },] </code_snipet> Or, in the deprecated eslintrc config format: <code_snipet> module.exports = { plugins: [ 'eslint-plugin-react-compiler', ], rules: { 'react-compiler/react-compiler': 'error', },} </code_snipet> The ESLint plugin will display any violations of the rules of React in your editor.

This is perfectly okay, and the compiler can recover and continue optimizing other components in your codebase. Note You don’t have to fix all ESLint violations straight away. You can address them at your own pace to increase the amount of components and hooks being optimized, but it is not required to fix everything before you can use the compiler. Rolling out the compiler to your codebase Existing projects The compiler is designed to compile functional components and hooks that follow the Rules of React . It can also handle code that breaks those rules by bailing out (skipping over) those components or hooks. However, due to the flexible nature of JavaScript, the compiler cannot catch every possible violation and may compile with false negatives: that is, the compiler may accidentally compile a component/hook that breaks the Rules of React which can lead to undefined behavior. For this reason, to adopt the compiler successfully on existing projects, we recommend running it on a small directory in your product code first. You can do this by configuring the compiler to only run on a specific set of directories: <code_snipet> const ReactCompilerConfig = { sources: (filename) => { return filename.indexOf('src/path/to/dir') !== -1; },}; </code_snipet> When you have more confidence with rolling out the compiler, you can expand coverage to other directories as well and slowly roll it out to your whole app. New projects If you’re starting a new project, you can enable the compiler on your entire codebase, which is the default behavior. Using React Compiler with React 17 or 18 React Compiler works best with React 19 RC. If you are unable to upgrade, you can install the extra react-compiler-runtime package which will allow the compiled code to run on versions prior to 19. However, note that the minimum supported version is 17. Terminal Copy <code_snipet> npm install  </code_snipet> You\"),\n",

Because React Compiler needs to run on the original source code prior to any code transformations, it is not possible for an application’s build pipeline to compile the libraries they use. Hence, our recommendation is for library maintainers to independently compile and test their libraries with the compiler, and ship compiled code to npm. Because your code is pre-compiled, users of your library will not need to have the compiler enabled in order to benefit from the automatic memoization applied to your library. If your library targets apps not yet on React 19, specify a minimum target and add react-compiler-runtime as a direct dependency . The runtime package will use the correct implementation of APIs depending on the application’s version, and polyfill the missing APIs if necessary. Library code can often require more complex patterns and usage of escape hatches. For this reason, we recommend ensuring that you have sufficient testing in order to identify any issues that might arise from using the compiler on your library. If you identify any issues, you can always opt-out the specific components or hooks with the 'use no memo' directive .

Usage Babel Terminal Copy <code_snipet> npm install  </code_snipet> The compiler includes a Babel plugin which you can use in your build pipeline to run the compiler. After installing, add it to your Babel config. Please note that it’s critical that the compiler run first in the pipeline: <code_snipet> // babel.config.jsconst ReactCompilerConfig = { /* ... */ };module.exports = function () { return { plugins: [ [\\'babel-plugin-react-compiler\\', ReactCompilerConfig], // must run first! // ... ], };}; </code_snipet> babel-plugin-react-compiler should run first before other Babel plugins as the compiler requires the input source information for sound analysis. Vite If you use Vite, you can add the plugin to vite-plugin-react: <code_snipet> // vite.config.jsconst ReactCompilerConfig = { /* ... */ };export default defineConfig(() => { return { plugins: [ react({ babel: { plugins: [ [\"babel-plugin-react-compiler\", ReactCompilerConfig], ], }, }), ], // ... };}); </code_snipet> Next.js Please refer to the Next.js docs for more information.

Troubleshooting To report issues, please first create a minimal repro on the React Compiler Playground and include it in your bug report. You can open issues in the facebook/react repo. You can also provide feedback in the React Compiler Working Group by applying to be a member. Please see the README for more details on joining . What does the compiler assume? React Compiler assumes that your code: Is valid, semantic JavaScript. Tests that nullable/optional values and properties are defined before accessing them (for example, by enabling strictNullChecks if using TypeScript), i.e., if (object.nullableProperty) { object.nullableProperty.foo } or with optional-chaining object.nullableProperty?.foo . Follows the Rules of React . React Compiler can verify many of the Rules of React statically, and will safely skip compilation when it detects an error. To see the errors we recommend also installing eslint-plugin-react-compiler . How do I know my components have been optimized? React DevTools (v5.0+) and React Native DevTools have built-in support for React Compiler and will display a “Memo ✨” badge next to components that have been optimized by the compiler.

You can address them at your own pace to increase the amount of components and hooks being optimized. Due to the flexible and dynamic nature of JavaScript however, it’s not possible to comprehensively detect all cases. Bugs and undefined behavior such as infinite loops may occur in those cases. If your app doesn’t work properly after compilation and you aren’t seeing any ESLint errors, the compiler may be incorrectly compiling your code. To confirm this, try to make the issue go away by aggressively opting out any component or hook you think might be related via the \"use no memo\" directive . <code_snipet> function SuspiciousComponent() { \"use no memo\"; // opts out this component from being compiled by React Compiler // ...} </code_snipet> Note \"use no memo\" \"use no memo\" is a temporary escape hatch that lets you opt-out components and hooks from being compiled by the React Compiler. This directive is not meant to be long lived the same way as eg \"use client\" is. It is not recommended to reach for this directive unless it’s strictly necessary. Once you opt-out a component or hook, it is opted-out forever until the directive is removed. This means that even if you fix the code, the compiler will still skip over compiling it unless you remove the directive. When you make the error go away, confirm that removing the opt out directive makes the issue come back.

Learn React Describing the UI Your First Component Components are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI), which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey! You will learn What a component is What role components play in a React application How to write your first React component Components: UI building blocks On the Web, HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its built-in set of tags like <h1> and <li> : <code_snipet> <article> <h1>My First Component</h1> <ol> <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li> <li>Defining a Component</li> <li>Using a Component</li> </ol></article> </code_snipet> This markup represents this article <article> , its heading\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='<ol> <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li> <li>Defining a Component</li> <li>Using a Component</li> </ol></article> </code_snipet> This markup represents this article <article> , its heading <h1> , and an (abbreviated) table of contents as an ordered list <ol> . Markup like this, combined with CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity, lies behind every sidebar, avatar, modal, dropdown—every piece of UI you see on the Web. React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom “components”, reusable UI elements for your app. The table of contents code you saw above could be turned into a <TableOfContents /> component you could render on every page. Under the hood, it still uses the same HTML tags like <article> , <h1> , etc. Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. For example, the documentation page you’re reading is made out of React components: <code_snipet> <PageLayout> <NavigationHeader> <SearchBar /> <Link to=\"/docs\">Docs</Link> </NavigationHeader> <Sidebar /> <PageContent> <TableOfContents /> <DocumentationText /> </PageContent></PageLayout> </code_snipet> As your project grows, you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development. Our table of contents above could be added to any screen with <TableOfContents /> ! You can even jumpstart your project with the thousands of components shared by the React open source community like Chakra UI and Material UI. Defining a component Traditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript. This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it is expected for many sites and all apps. React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: a React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup . Here’s what that looks like (you can edit the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: a React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup . Here’s what that looks like (you can edit the example below): App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function Profile() { return ( <img src=\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" /> ) } And here’s how to build a component: Step 1: Export the component The export default prefix is a standard JavaScript syntax (not specific to React). It lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files. (More on importing in Importing and Exporting Components !) Step 2: Define the function With function Profile() { } you define a JavaScript function with the name Profile . Pitfall React components are regular JavaScript functions, but their names must start with a capital letter or they won’t work! Step 3: Add markup The component returns an <img /> tag with src and alt attributes. <img /> is written like HTML, but it is actually JavaScript under the hood! This syntax is called JSX , and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript. Return statements can be written all on one line, as in this component: <code_snipet> return <img src=\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" />; </code_snipet> But if your markup isn’t all on the same line as the return keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses: <code_snipet> return ( <div> <img src=\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" /> </div>); </code_snipet> Pitfall Without parentheses, any code on the lines after return will be ignored ! Using a component Now that you’ve defined your Profile component, you can nest it inside other components. For example, you can export a Gallery component that uses multiple Profile components: App.js App.js Reset Fork function Profile() { return ( <img src=\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" /> ); } export default function Gallery() { return ( <section> <h1>Amazing scientists</h1> <Profile /> <Profile /> <Profile /> </section> ); } Show more What the browser sees'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" /> ); } export default function Gallery() { return ( <section> <h1>Amazing scientists</h1> <Profile /> <Profile /> <Profile /> </section> ); } Show more What the browser sees Notice the difference in casing: <section> is lowercase, so React knows we refer to an HTML tag. <Profile /> starts with a capital P , so React knows that we want to use our component called Profile . And Profile contains even more HTML: <img /> . In the end, this is what the browser sees: <code_snipet> <section> <h1>Amazing scientists</h1> <img src=\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" /> <img src=\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" /> <img src=\" alt=\"Katherine Johnson\" /></section> </code_snipet> Nesting and organizing components Components are regular JavaScript functions, so you can keep multiple components in the same file. This is convenient when components are relatively small or tightly related to each other. If this file gets crowded, you can always move Profile to a separate file. You will learn how to do this shortly on the page about imports. Because the Profile components are rendered inside Gallery —even several times!—we can say that Gallery is a parent component, rendering each Profile as a “child”. This is part of the magic of React: you can define a component once, and then use it in as many places and as many times as you like. Pitfall Components can render other components, but you must never nest their definitions: <code_snipet> export default function Gallery() { // 🔴 Never define a component inside another component! function Profile() { // ... } // ...} </code_snipet> The snippet above is very slow and causes bugs. Instead, define every component at the top level: <code_snipet> export default function Gallery() { // ...}// ✅ Declare components at the top levelfunction Profile() { // ...} </code_snipet> When a child component needs some data from a parent, pass it by props instead of nesting definitions.

Deep Dive Components all the way down Show Details Your React application begins at a “root” component. Usually, it is created automatically when you start a new project. For example, if you use CodeSandbox or if you use the framework Next.js , the root component is defined in pages/index.js . In these examples, you’ve been exporting root components. Most React apps use components all the way down. This means that you won’t only use components for reusable pieces like buttons, but also for larger pieces like sidebars, lists, and ultimately, complete pages! Components are a handy way to organize UI code and markup, even if some of them are only used once. React-based frameworks take this a step further. Instead of using an empty HTML file and letting React “take over” managing the page with JavaScript, they also generate the HTML automatically from your React components. This allows your app to show some content before the JavaScript code loads. Still, many websites only use React to add interactivity to existing HTML pages. They have many root components instead of a single one for the entire page. You can use as much—or as little—React as you need. Recap You’ve just gotten your first taste of React! Let’s recap some key points. React lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app. In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.

You will learn What a root component file is How to import and export a component When to use default and named imports and exports How to import and export multiple components from one file How to split components into multiple files The root component file In Your First Component , you made a Profile component and a Gallery component that renders it:\"),\n",

Depending on your setup, your root component could be in another file, though. If you use a framework with file-based routing, such as Next.js, your root component will be different for every page. Exporting and importing a component What if you want to change the landing screen in the future and put a list of science books there? Or place all the profiles somewhere else? It makes sense to move Gallery and Profile out of the root component file. This will make them more modular and reusable in other files. You can move a component in three steps: Make a new JS file to put the components in. Export your function component from that file (using either default or named exports). Import it in the file where you’ll use the component (using the corresponding technique for importing default or named exports). Here both Profile and Gallery have been moved out of App.js into a new file called Gallery.js . Now you can change App.js to import Gallery from Gallery.js : App.js Gallery.js App.js Reset Fork import Gallery from \\'./Gallery.js\\'; export default function App() { return ( <Gallery /> ); } Notice how this example is broken down into two component files now: Gallery.js : Defines the Profile component which is only used within the same file and is not exported.

Deep Dive Default vs named exports Show Details There are two primary ways to export values with JavaScript: default exports and named exports. So far, our examples have only used default exports. But you can use one or both of them in the same file. A file can have no more than one default export, but it can have as many named exports as you like. How you export your component dictates how you must import it. You will get an error if you try to import a default export the same way you would a named export! This chart can help you keep track: Syntax Export statement Import statement Default export default function Button() {} import Button from './Button.js'; Named export function Button() {} import { Button } from './Button.js'; When you write a default import, you can put any name you want after import . For example, you could write import Banana from './Button.js' instead and it would still provide you with the same default export. In contrast, with named imports, the name has to match on both sides. That’s why they are called named imports! People often use default exports if the file exports only one component, and use named exports if it exports multiple components and values. Regardless of which coding style you prefer, always give meaningful names to your component functions and the files that contain them. Components without names, like export default () => {} , are discouraged because they make debugging harder.

Exporting and importing multiple components from the same file What if you want to show just one Profile instead of a gallery? You can export the Profile component, too. But Gallery.js already has a default export, and you can’t have two default exports. You could create a new file with a default export, or you could add a named export for Profile . A file can only have one default export, but it can have numerous named exports! Note To reduce the potential confusion between default and named exports, some teams choose to only stick to one style (default or named), or avoid mixing them in a single file. Do what works best for you! First, export Profile from Gallery.js using a named export (no default keyword): <code_snipet> export function Profile() { // ...} </code_snipet> Then, import Profile from Gallery.js to App.js using a named import (with the curly braces): <code_snipet> import { Profile } from './Gallery.js'; </code_snipet> Finally, render <Profile /> from the App component: <code_snipet> export default function App() { return <Profile />;} </code_snipet> Now Gallery.js contains two exports: a default Gallery export, and a named Profile export. App.js imports both of them. Try editing <Profile /> to <Gallery /> and back in this example: App.js Gallery.js App.js Reset Fork import Gallery from './Gallery.js'; import { Profile } from './Gallery.js'; export default function App() { return ( <Profile /> ); } Now you’re using a mix of default and named exports: Gallery.js : Exports the Profile component as a named export called Profile .

Learn React Describing the UI Writing Markup with JSX JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. Although there are other ways to write components, most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it. You will learn Why React mixes markup with rendering logic How JSX is different from HTML How to display information with JSX JSX: Putting markup into JavaScript The Web has been built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For many years, web developers kept content in HTML, design in CSS, and logic in JavaScript—often in separate files!

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='in HTML, design in CSS, and logic in JavaScript—often in separate files! Content was marked up inside HTML while the page’s logic lived separately in JavaScript: HTML JavaScript But as the Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined content. JavaScript was in charge of the HTML! This is why in React, rendering logic and markup live together in the same place—components. Sidebar.js React component Form.js React component Keeping a button’s rendering logic and markup together ensures that they stay in sync with each other on every edit. Conversely, details that are unrelated, such as the button’s markup and a sidebar’s markup, are isolated from each other, making it safer to change either of them on their own. Each React component is a JavaScript function that may contain some markup that React renders into the browser. React components use a syntax extension called JSX to represent that markup. JSX looks a lot like HTML, but it is a bit stricter and can display dynamic information. The best way to understand this is to convert some HTML markup to JSX markup. Note JSX and React are two separate things. They’re often used together, but you can use them independently of each other. JSX is a syntax extension, while React is a JavaScript library. Converting HTML to JSX Suppose that you have some (perfectly valid) HTML: <code_snipet> <h1>Hedy Lamarr\\'s Todos</h1><img src=\" alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" class=\"photo\"><ul> <li>Invent new traffic lights <li>Rehearse a movie scene <li>Improve the spectrum technology</ul> </code_snipet> And you want to put it into your component: <code_snipet> export default function TodoList() { return ( // ??? )} </code_snipet> If you copy and paste it as is, it will not work: App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function TodoList() { return ( // This doesn\\'t quite work! <h1>Hedy Lamarr\\'s Todos</h1> <img src=\" alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" class=\"photo\" > <ul> <li>Invent new traffic lights <li>Rehearse a movie scene <li>Improve the spectrum'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='{ return ( // This doesn\\'t quite work! <h1>Hedy Lamarr\\'s Todos</h1> <img src=\" alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" class=\"photo\" > <ul> <li>Invent new traffic lights <li>Rehearse a movie scene <li>Improve the spectrum technology </ul> Show more This is because JSX is stricter and has a few more rules than HTML! If you read the error messages above, they’ll guide you to fix the markup, or you can follow the guide below. Note Most of the time, React’s on-screen error messages will help you find where the problem is. Give them a read if you get stuck! The Rules of JSX 1. Return a single root element To return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag. For example, you can use a <div> : <code_snipet> <div> <h1>Hedy Lamarr\\'s Todos</h1> <img src=\" alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" class=\"photo\" > <ul> ... </ul></div> </code_snipet> If you don’t want to add an extra <div> to your markup, you can write <> and </> instead: <code_snipet> <> <h1>Hedy Lamarr\\'s Todos</h1> <img src=\" alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" class=\"photo\" > <ul> ... </ul></> </code_snipet> This empty tag is called a Fragment. Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree. Deep Dive Why do multiple JSX tags need to be wrapped? Show Details JSX looks like HTML, but under the hood it is transformed into plain JavaScript objects. You can’t return two objects from a function without wrapping them into an array. This explains why you also can’t return two JSX tags without wrapping them into another tag or a Fragment. 2. Close all the tags JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like <img> must become <img /> , and wrapping tags like <li>oranges must be written as <li>oranges</li> . This is how Hedy Lamarr’s image and list items look closed: <code_snipet> <> <img src=\" alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" class=\"photo\" /> <ul> <li>Invent new traffic lights</li> <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li> <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li> </ul></> </code_snipet> 3. camelCase all most of the things!'),\n",

JSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript objects. In your own components, you will often want to read those attributes into variables. But JavaScript has limitations on variable names. For example, their names can’t contain dashes or be reserved words like class . This is why, in React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase. For example, instead of stroke-width you use strokeWidth . Since class is a reserved word, in React you write className instead, named after the corresponding DOM property : <code_snipet> <img src=\" alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" className=\"photo\"/> </code_snipet> You can find all these attributes in the list of DOM component props. If you get one wrong, don’t worry—React will print a message with a possible correction to the browser console. Pitfall For historical reasons, aria-* and data-* attributes are written as in HTML with dashes. Pro-tip: Use a JSX Converter Converting all these attributes in existing markup can be tedious! We recommend using a converter to translate your existing HTML and SVG to JSX. Converters are very useful in practice, but it’s still worth understanding what is going on so that you can comfortably write JSX on your own. Here is your final result: App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function TodoList() { return ( <> <h1>Hedy Lamarr\\'s Todos</h1> <img src=\" alt=\"Hedy Lamarr\" className=\"photo\" /> <ul> <li>Invent new traffic lights</li> <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li> <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li> </ul> </> ); } Show more Recap Now you know why JSX exists and how to use it in components: React components group rendering logic together with markup because they are related.

Learn React Describing the UI JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to open a window to JavaScript. You will learn How to pass strings with quotes How to reference a JavaScript variable inside JSX with curly braces How to call a JavaScript function inside JSX with curly braces How to use a JavaScript object inside JSX with curly braces Passing strings with quotes When you want to pass a string attribute to JSX, you put it in single or double\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='inside JSX with curly braces How to use a JavaScript object inside JSX with curly braces Passing strings with quotes When you want to pass a string attribute to JSX, you put it in single or double quotes: App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function Avatar() { return ( <img className=\"avatar\" src=\" alt=\"Gregorio Y. Zara\" /> ); } Here, \" and \"Gregorio Y. Zara\" are being passed as strings. But what if you want to dynamically specify the src or alt text? You could use a value from JavaScript by replacing \" and \" with { and } : App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function Avatar() { const avatar = \\' const description = \\'Gregorio Y. Zara\\'; return ( <img className=\"avatar\" src={avatar} alt={description} /> ); } Notice the difference between className=\"avatar\" , which specifies an \"avatar\" CSS class name that makes the image round, and src={avatar} that reads the value of the JavaScript variable called avatar . That’s because curly braces let you work with JavaScript right there in your markup! Using curly braces: A window into the JavaScript world JSX is a special way of writing JavaScript. That means it’s possible to use JavaScript inside it—with curly braces { } . The example below first declares a name for the scientist, name , then embeds it with curly braces inside the <h1> : App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function TodoList() { const name = \\'Gregorio Y. Zara\\'; return ( <h1>{name}\\'s To Do List</h1> ); } Try changing the name ’s value from \\'Gregorio Y. Zara\\' to \\'Hedy Lamarr\\' . See how the list title changes? Any JavaScript expression will work between curly braces, including function calls like formatDate() : App.js App.js Reset Fork const today = new Date(); function formatDate(date) { return new Intl.DateTimeFormat( \\'en-US\\', { weekday: \\'long\\' } ).format(date); } export default function TodoList() { return ( <h1>To Do List for {formatDate(today)}</h1> ); } Where to use curly braces You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX: As text'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='} export default function TodoList() { return ( <h1>To Do List for {formatDate(today)}</h1> ); } Where to use curly braces You can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX: As text directly inside a JSX tag: <h1>{name}\\'s To Do List</h1> works, but <{tag}>Gregorio Y. Zara\\'s To Do List</{tag}> will not. As attributes immediately following the = sign: src={avatar} will read the avatar variable, but src=\"{avatar}\" will pass the string \"{avatar}\" . Using “double curlies”: CSS and other objects in JSX In addition to strings, numbers, and other JavaScript expressions, you can even pass objects in JSX. Objects are also denoted with curly braces, like { name: \"Hedy Lamarr\", inventions: 5 } . Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: person={{ name: \"Hedy Lamarr\", inventions: 5 }} . You may see this with inline CSS styles in JSX. React does not require you to use inline styles (CSS classes work great for most cases). But when you need an inline style, you pass an object to the style attribute: App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function TodoList() { return ( <ul style={{ backgroundColor: \\'black\\', color: \\'pink\\' }}> <li>Improve the videophone</li> <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li> <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li> </ul> ); } Try changing the values of backgroundColor and color . You can really see the JavaScript object inside the curly braces when you write it like this: <code_snipet> <ul style={ { backgroundColor: \\'black\\', color: \\'pink\\' }}> </code_snipet> The next time you see {{ and }} in JSX, know that it’s nothing more than an object inside the JSX curlies! Pitfall Inline style properties are written in camelCase. For example, HTML <ul style=\"background-color: black\"> would be written as <ul style={{ backgroundColor: \\'black\\' }}> in your component.

Zara\" /> <ul> <li>Improve the videophone</li> <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li> <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li> </ul> </div> ); } Show more In this example, the person JavaScript object contains a name string and a theme object: <code_snipet> const person = { name: \\'Gregorio Y. Zara\\', theme: { backgroundColor: \\'black\\', color: \\'pink\\' }}; </code_snipet> The component can use these values from person like so: <code_snipet> <div style={person.theme}> <h1>{person.name}\\'s Todos</h1> </code_snipet> JSX is very minimal as a templating language because it lets you organize data and logic using JavaScript. Recap Now you know almost everything about JSX: JSX attributes inside quotes are passed as strings. Curly braces let you bring JavaScript logic and variables into your markup. They work inside the JSX tag content or immediately after = in attributes. {{ and }} is not special syntax: it’s a JavaScript object tucked inside JSX curly braces. Try out some challenges 1 .

You will learn How to pass props to a component How to read props from a component How to specify default values for props How to pass some JSX to a component How props change over time Familiar props Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag.

But you can pass any props to your own components, such as <Avatar> , to customize them. Here’s how! Passing props to a component In this code, the Profile component isn’t passing any props to its child component, Avatar : <code_snipet> export default function Profile() { return ( <Avatar /> );} </code_snipet> You can give Avatar some props in two steps. Step 1: Pass props to the child component First, pass some props to Avatar . For example, let’s pass two props: person (an object), and size (a number): <code_snipet> export default function Profile() { return ( <Avatar person={{ name: \\'Lin Lanying\\', imageId: \\'1bX5QH6\\' }} size={100} /> );} </code_snipet> Note If double curly braces after person= confuse you, recall they’re merely an object inside the JSX curlies. Now you can read these props inside the Avatar component. Step 2: Read props inside the child component You can read these props by listing their names person, size separated by the commas inside ({ and }) directly after function Avatar . This lets you use them inside the Avatar code, like you would with a variable. <code_snipet> function Avatar({ person, size }) { // person and size are available here} </code_snipet> Add some logic to Avatar that uses the person and size props for rendering, and you’re done. Now you can configure Avatar to render in many different ways with different props. Try tweaking the values! App.js utils.js App.js Reset Fork import { getImageUrl } from \\'./utils.js\\'; function Avatar({ person, size }) { return ('),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='render in many different ways with different props. Try tweaking the values! App.js utils.js App.js Reset Fork import { getImageUrl } from \\'./utils.js\\'; function Avatar({ person, size }) { return ( <img className=\"avatar\" src={getImageUrl(person)} alt={person.name} width={size} height={size} /> ); } export default function Profile() { return ( <div> <Avatar size={100} person={{ name: \\'Katsuko Saruhashi\\', imageId: \\'YfeOqp2\\' }} /> <Avatar size={80} person={{ name: \\'Aklilu Lemma\\', imageId: \\'OKS67lh\\' }} /> <Avatar size={50} person={{ name: \\'Lin Lanying\\', imageId: \\'1bX5QH6\\' }} /> </div> ); } Show more Props let you think about parent and child components independently. For example, you can change the person or the size props inside Profile without having to think about how Avatar uses them. Similarly, you can change how the Avatar uses these props, without looking at the Profile . You can think of props like “knobs” that you can adjust. They serve the same role as arguments serve for functions—in fact, props are the only argument to your component! React component functions accept a single argument, a props object: <code_snipet> function Avatar(props) { let person = props.person; let size = props.size; // ...} </code_snipet> Usually you don’t need the whole props object itself, so you destructure it into individual props. Pitfall Don’t miss the pair of { and } curlies inside of ( and ) when declaring props: <code_snipet> function Avatar({ person, size }) { // ...} </code_snipet> This syntax is called “destructuring” and is equivalent to reading properties from a function parameter: <code_snipet> function Avatar(props) { let person = props.person; let size = props.size; // ...} </code_snipet> Specifying a default value for a prop If you want to give a prop a default value to fall back on when no value is specified, you can do it with the destructuring by putting = and the default value right after the parameter: <code_snipet> function Avatar({ person, size = 100 }) { //'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='fall back on when no value is specified, you can do it with the destructuring by putting = and the default value right after the parameter: <code_snipet> function Avatar({ person, size = 100 }) { // ...} </code_snipet> Now, if <Avatar person={...} /> is rendered with no size prop, the size will be set to 100 . The default value is only used if the size prop is missing or if you pass size={undefined} . But if you pass size={null} or size={0} , the default value will not be used. Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax Sometimes, passing props gets very repetitive: <code_snipet> function Profile({ person, size, isSepia, thickBorder }) { return ( <div className=\"card\"> <Avatar person={person} size={size} isSepia={isSepia} thickBorder={thickBorder} /> </div> );} </code_snipet> There’s nothing wrong with repetitive code—it can be more legible. But at times you may value conciseness. Some components forward all of their props to their children, like how this Profile does with Avatar . Because they don’t use any of their props directly, it can make sense to use a more concise “spread” syntax: <code_snipet> function Profile(props) { return ( <div className=\"card\"> <Avatar {...props} /> </div> );} </code_snipet> This forwards all of Profile ’s props to the Avatar without listing each of their names. Use spread syntax with restraint. If you’re using it in every other component, something is wrong. Often, it indicates that you should split your components and pass children as JSX. More on that next! Passing JSX as children It is common to nest built-in browser tags: <code_snipet> <div> <img /></div> </code_snipet> Sometimes you’ll want to nest your own components the same way: <code_snipet> <Card> <Avatar /></Card> </code_snipet> When you nest content inside a JSX tag, the parent component will receive that content in a prop called children . For example, the Card component below will receive a children prop set to <Avatar /> and render it in a wrapper div: App.js'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='the parent component will receive that content in a prop called children . For example, the Card component below will receive a children prop set to <Avatar /> and render it in a wrapper div: App.js Avatar.js utils.js App.js Reset Fork import Avatar from \\'./Avatar.js\\'; function Card({ children }) { return ( <div className=\"card\"> {children} </div> ); } export default function Profile() { return ( <Card> <Avatar size={100} person={{ name: \\'Katsuko Saruhashi\\', imageId: \\'YfeOqp2\\' }} /> </Card> ); } Show more Try replacing the <Avatar> inside <Card> with some text to see how the Card component can wrap any nested content. It doesn’t need to “know” what’s being rendered inside of it. You will see this flexible pattern in many places. You can think of a component with a children prop as having a “hole” that can be “filled in” by its parent components with arbitrary JSX. You will often use the children prop for visual wrappers: panels, grids, etc. Illustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors How props change over time The Clock component below receives two props from its parent component: color and time . (The parent component’s code is omitted because it uses state , which we won’t dive into just yet.) Try changing the color in the select box below: Clock.js Clock.js Reset Fork export default function Clock({ color, time }) { return ( <h1 style={{ color: color }}> {time} </h1> ); } This example illustrates that a component may receive different props over time. Props are not always static! Here, the time prop changes every second, and the color prop changes when you select another color. Props reflect a component’s data at any point in time, rather than only in the beginning. However, props are immutable —a term from computer science meaning “unchangeable”. When a component needs to change its props (for example, in response to a user interaction or new data), it will have to “ask” its parent component to pass it different props —a new object! Its old props will then be cast aside,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='its props (for example, in response to a user interaction or new data), it will have to “ask” its parent component to pass it different props —a new object! Its old props will then be cast aside, and eventually the JavaScript engine will reclaim the memory taken by them. Don’t try to “change props”. When you need to respond to the user input (like changing the selected color), you will need to “set state”, which you can learn about in State: A Component’s Memory. Recap To pass props, add them to the JSX, just like you would with HTML attributes. To read props, use the function Avatar({ person, size }) destructuring syntax. You can specify a default value like size = 100 , which is used for missing and undefined props. You can forward all props with <Avatar {...props} /> JSX spread syntax, but don’t overuse it! Nested JSX like <Card><Avatar /></Card> will appear as Card component’s children prop. Props are read-only snapshots in time: every render receives a new version of props. You can’t change props. When you need interactivity, you’ll need to set state. Try out some challenges 1 . Extract a component 2 . Adjust the image size based on a prop 3 . Passing JSX in a children prop Challenge 1 of 3 : Extract a component This Gallery component contains some very similar markup for two profiles.

Notice how you’re creating branching logic with JavaScript’s if and return statements. In React, control flow (like conditions) is handled by JavaScript. Conditionally returning nothing with null In some situations, you won’t want to render anything at all. For example, say you don’t want to show packed items at all. A component must return something. In this case, you can return null : <code_snipet> if (isPacked) { return null;}return <li className=\"item\">{name}</li>; </code_snipet> If isPacked is true, the component will return nothing, null .

More often, you would conditionally include or exclude the component in the parent component’s JSX. Here’s how to do that! Conditionally including JSX In the previous example, you controlled which (if any!) JSX tree would be returned by the component. You may already have noticed some duplication in the render output: <code_snipet> <li className=\"item\">{name} ✅</li> </code_snipet> is very similar to <code_snipet> <li className=\"item\">{name}</li> </code_snipet> Both of the conditional branches return <li className=\"item\">...</li> : <code_snipet> if (isPacked) { return <li className=\"item\">{name} ✅</li>;}return <li className=\"item\">{name}</li>; </code_snipet> While this duplication isn’t harmful, it could make your code harder to maintain. What if you want to change the className ? You’d have to do it in two places in your code! In such a situation, you could conditionally include a little JSX to make your code more DRY. Conditional (ternary) operator ( ? : ) JavaScript has a compact syntax for writing a conditional expression — the conditional operator or “ternary operator”. Instead of this: <code_snipet> if (isPacked) { return <li className=\"item\">{name} ✅</li>;}return <li className=\"item\">{name}</li>; </code_snipet> You can'),\n",

Deep Dive Are these two examples fully equivalent? Show Details If you’re coming from an object-oriented programming background, you might assume that the two examples above are subtly different because one of them may create two different “instances” of <li> . But JSX elements aren’t “instances” because they don’t hold any internal state and aren’t real DOM nodes. They’re lightweight descriptions, like blueprints. So these two examples, in fact, are completely equivalent. Preserving and Resetting State goes into detail about how this works. Now let’s say you want to wrap the completed item’s text into another HTML tag, like <del> to strike it out. You can add even more newlines and parentheses so that it’s easier to nest more JSX in each of the cases: App.js App.js Reset Fork function Item({ name, isPacked }) { return ( <li className=\"item\"> {isPacked ? ( <del> {name + \\' ✅\\'} </del> ) : ( name )} </li> ); } export default function PackingList() { return ( <section> <h1>Sally Ride\\'s Packing List</h1> <ul> <Item isPacked={true} name=\"Space suit\" /> <Item isPacked={true} name=\"Helmet with a golden leaf\" /> <Item isPacked={false} name=\"Photo of Tam\" /> </ul> </section> ); } Show more This style works well for simple conditions, but use it in moderation.

Logical AND operator ( && ) Another common shortcut you’ll encounter is the JavaScript logical AND ( && ) operator. Inside React components, it often comes up when you want to render some JSX when the condition is true, or render nothing otherwise. With && , you could conditionally render the checkmark only if isPacked is true : <code_snipet> return ( <li className=\"item\"> {name} {isPacked && \\'✅\\'} </li>); </code_snipet> You can read this as “if isPacked , then ( && ) render the checkmark, otherwise, render nothing” .

But if the condition is false , the whole expression becomes false . React considers false as a “hole” in the JSX tree, just like null or undefined , and doesn’t render anything in its place. Pitfall Don’t put numbers on the left side of && . To test the condition, JavaScript converts the left side to a boolean automatically. However, if the left side is 0 , then the whole expression gets that value ( 0 ), and React will happily render 0 rather than nothing. For example, a common mistake is to write code like messageCount && <p>New messages</p> . It’s easy to assume that it renders nothing when messageCount is 0 , but it really renders the 0 itself!

You can return a JSX expression conditionally with an if statement. You can conditionally save some JSX to a variable and then include it inside other JSX by using the curly braces. In JSX, {cond ? <A /> : <B />} means “if cond , render <A /> , otherwise <B /> ” . In JSX, {cond && <A />} means “if cond , render <A /> , otherwise nothing” .

You will often need to show several instances of the same component using different data when building interfaces: from lists of comments to galleries of profile images. In these situations, you can store that data in JavaScript objects and arrays and use methods like map() and filter() to render lists of components from them. Here’s a short example of how to generate a list of items from an array: Move the data into an array: <code_snipet> const people = [ 'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician', 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist', 'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist', 'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist', 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist']; </code_snipet> Map the people members into a new array of JSX nodes, listItems : <code_snipet> const listItems = people.map(person => <li>{person}</li>); </code_snipet> Return listItems from your component wrapped in a <ul> : <code_snipet> return <ul>{listItems}</ul>; </code_snipet> Here is the result: App.js App.js Reset Fork const people = [ 'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician', 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist', 'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist', 'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist', 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist' ]; export default function List() { const listItems = people.map(person => <li>{person}</li> ); return <ul>{listItems}</ul>; } Notice the sandbox above displays a console error: Console Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop.

You can use JavaScript’s filter() method to return just those people. This method takes an array of items, passes them through a “test” (a function that returns true or false ), and returns a new array of only those items that passed the test (returned true ). You only want the items where profession is 'chemist' . The “test” function for this looks like (person) => person.profession === 'chemist' . Here’s how to put it together: Create a new array of just “chemist” people, chemists , by calling filter() on the people filtering by person.profession === 'chemist' : <code_snipet> const chemists = people.filter(person => person.profession === 'chemist'); </code_snipet> Now map over chemists : <code_snipet> const listItems = chemists.map(person => <li> <img src={getImageUrl(person)} alt={person.name} /> <p> <b>{person.name}:</b> {' ' + person.profession + ' '} known for {person.accomplishment} </p> </li>); </code_snipet> Lastly, return the listItems from your component: <code_snipet> return <ul>{listItems}</ul>; </code_snipet> App.js data.js utils.js App.js Reset Fork import { people } from './data.js'; import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js'; export default function List() { const chemists = people.filter(person => person.profession === 'chemist' ); const listItems =\"),\n",

They let you write more than a single line of code, but you have to write a return statement yourself. If you forget it, nothing gets returned! Keeping list items in order with key Notice that all the sandboxes above show an error in the console: Console Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop. You need to give each array item a key — a string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array: <code_snipet> <li key={person.id}>...</li> </code_snipet> Note JSX elements directly inside a map() call always need keys! Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen key helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree. Rather than generating keys on the fly, you should include them in your data: App.js data.js utils.js data.js Reset Fork export const people = [{ id: 0, // Used in JSX as a key name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',\"),\n",

The short <>...</> Fragment syntax won’t let you pass a key, so you need to either group them into a single <div> , or use the slightly longer and more explicit <Fragment> syntax: <code_snipet> import { Fragment } from 'react';// ...const listItems = people.map(person => <Fragment key={person.id}> <h1>{person.name}</h1> <p>{person.bio}</p> </Fragment>); </code_snipet> Fragments disappear from the DOM, so this will produce a flat list of <h1> , <p> , <h1> , <p> , and so on. Where to get your key Different sources of data provide different sources of keys: Data from a database: If your data is coming from a database, you can use the database keys/IDs, which are unique by nature.

Locally generated data: If your data is generated and persisted locally (e.g. notes in a note-taking app), use an incrementing counter, crypto.randomUUID() or a package like uuid when creating items. Rules of keys Keys must be unique among siblings. However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in different arrays. Keys must not change or that defeats their purpose! Don’t generate them while rendering. Why does React need keys? Imagine that files on your desktop didn’t have names. Instead, you’d refer to them by their order — the first file, the second file, and so on. You could get used to it, but once you delete a file, it would get confusing. The second file would become the first file, the third file would be the second file, and so on. File names in a folder and JSX keys in an array serve a similar purpose. They let us uniquely identify an item between its siblings. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the position changes due to reordering, the key lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime. Pitfall You might be tempted to use an item’s index in the array as its key. In fact, that’s what React will use if you don’t specify a key at all. But the order in which you render items will change over time if an item is inserted, deleted, or if the array gets reordered. Index as a key often leads to subtle and confusing bugs. Similarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. with key={Math.random()} . This will cause keys to never match up between renders, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated every time. Not only is this slow, but it will also lose any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data. Note that your components won’t receive key as a prop. It’s only used as a hint by React itself. If your component needs an ID, you have to pass it as a separate prop: <Profile key={id} userId={id} /> . Recap On this page you'),\n",

Learn React Describing the UI Keeping Components Pure Some JavaScript functions are pure. Pure functions only perform a calculation and nothing more. By strictly only writing your components as pure functions, you can avoid an entire class of baffling bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows. To get these benefits, though, there are a few rules you must follow. You will learn What purity is and how it helps you avoid bugs How to keep components pure by keeping changes out of the render phase How to use Strict Mode to find mistakes in your components Purity: Components as formulas In computer science (and especially the world of functional programming), a pure function is a function with the following characteristics:\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='mistakes in your components Purity: Components as formulas In computer science (and especially the world of functional programming), a pure function is a function with the following characteristics: It minds its own business. It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called. Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result. You might already be familiar with one example of pure functions: formulas in math. Consider this math formula: y = 2 x . If x = 2 then y = 4 . Always. If x = 3 then y = 6 . Always. If x = 3 , y won’t sometimes be 9 or –1 or 2.5 depending on the time of day or the state of the stock market. If y = 2 x and x = 3 , y will always be 6 . If we made this into a JavaScript function, it would look like this: <code_snipet> function double(number) { return 2 * number;} </code_snipet> In the above example, double is a pure function. If you pass it 3 , it will return 6 . Always. React is designed around this concept. React assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs: App.js App.js Reset Fork function Recipe({ drinkers }) { return ( <ol> <li>Boil {drinkers} cups of water.</li> <li>Add {drinkers} spoons of tea and {0.5 * drinkers} spoons of spice.</li> <li>Add {0.5 * drinkers} cups of milk to boil and sugar to taste.</li> </ol> ); } export default function App() { return ( <section> <h1>Spiced Chai Recipe</h1> <h2>For two</h2> <Recipe drinkers={2} /> <h2>For a gathering</h2> <Recipe drinkers={4} /> </section> ); } Show more When you pass drinkers={2} to Recipe , it will return JSX containing 2 cups of water . Always. If you pass drinkers={4} , it will return JSX containing 4 cups of water . Always. Just like a math formula.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='4 cups of water . Always. Just like a math formula. You could think of your components as recipes: if you follow them and don’t introduce new ingredients during the cooking process, you will get the same dish every time. That “dish” is the JSX that the component serves to React to render. Illustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors Side Effects: (un)intended consequences React’s rendering process must always be pure. Components should only return their JSX, and not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering—that would make them impure! Here is a component that breaks this rule: App.js App.js Reset Fork let guest = 0; function Cup() { // Bad: changing a preexisting variable! guest = guest + 1; return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>; } export default function TeaSet() { return ( <> <Cup /> <Cup /> <Cup /> </> ); } Show more This component is reading and writing a guest variable declared outside of it. This means that calling this component multiple times will produce different JSX! And what’s more, if other components read guest , they will produce different JSX, too, depending on when they were rendered! That’s not predictable. Going back to our formula y = 2 x , now even if x = 2 , we cannot trust that y = 4 . Our tests could fail, our users would be baffled, planes would fall out of the sky—you can see how this would lead to confusing bugs! You can fix this component by passing guest as a prop instead : App.js App.js Reset Fork function Cup({ guest }) { return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>; } export default function TeaSet() { return ( <> <Cup guest={1} /> <Cup guest={2} /> <Cup guest={3} /> </> ); } Now your component is pure, as the JSX it returns only depends on the guest prop. In general, you should not expect your components to be rendered in any particular order. It doesn’t matter if you call y = 2 x before or after y = 5 x : both formulas will resolve independently of each other. In the same way, each component should only “think for'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='in any particular order. It doesn’t matter if you call y = 2 x before or after y = 5 x : both formulas will resolve independently of each other. In the same way, each component should only “think for itself”, and not attempt to coordinate with or depend upon others during rendering. Rendering is like a school exam: each component should calculate JSX on their own! Deep Dive Detecting impure calculations with StrictMode Show Details Although you might not have used them all yet, in React there are three kinds of inputs that you can read while rendering: props , state , and context. You should always treat these inputs as read-only. When you want to change something in response to user input, you should set state instead of writing to a variable. You should never change preexisting variables or objects while your component is rendering. React offers a “Strict Mode” in which it calls each component’s function twice during development. By calling the component functions twice, Strict Mode helps find components that break these rules. Notice how the original example displayed “Guest #2”, “Guest #4”, and “Guest #6” instead of “Guest #1”, “Guest #2”, and “Guest #3”. The original function was impure, so calling it twice broke it. But the fixed pure version works even if the function is called twice every time. Pure functions only calculate, so calling them twice won’t change anything —just like calling double(2) twice doesn’t change what’s returned, and solving y = 2 x twice doesn’t change what y is. Same inputs, same outputs. Always. Strict Mode has no effect in production, so it won’t slow down the app for your users. To opt into Strict Mode, you can wrap your root component into <React.StrictMode> . Some frameworks do this by default. Local mutation: Your component’s little secret In the above example, the problem was that the component changed a preexisting variable while rendering.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='secret In the above example, the problem was that the component changed a preexisting variable while rendering. This is often called a “mutation” to make it sound a bit scarier. Pure functions don’t mutate variables outside of the function’s scope or objects that were created before the call—that makes them impure! However, it’s completely fine to change variables and objects that you’ve just created while rendering. In this example, you create an [] array, assign it to a cups variable, and then push a dozen cups into it: App.js App.js Reset Fork function Cup({ guest }) { return <h2>Tea cup for guest #{guest}</h2>; } export default function TeaGathering() { let cups = []; for (let i = 1; i <= 12; i++) { cups.push(<Cup key={i} guest={i} />); } return cups; } If the cups variable or the [] array were created outside the TeaGathering function, this would be a huge problem! You would be changing a preexisting object by pushing items into that array. However, it’s fine because you’ve created them during the same render , inside TeaGathering . No code outside of TeaGathering will ever know that this happened. This is called “local mutation” —it’s like your component’s little secret. Where you can cause side effects While functional programming relies heavily on purity, at some point, somewhere, something has to change. That’s kind of the point of programming! These changes—updating the screen, starting an animation, changing the data—are called side effects. They’re things that happen “on the side” , not during rendering. In React, side effects usually belong inside event handlers. Event handlers are functions that React runs when you perform some action—for example, when you click a button. Even though event handlers are defined inside your component, they don’t run during rendering! So event handlers don’t need to be pure. If you’ve exhausted all other options and can’t find the right event handler for your side effect, you can still attach it to your returned JSX with'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='So event handlers don’t need to be pure. If you’ve exhausted all other options and can’t find the right event handler for your side effect, you can still attach it to your returned JSX with a useEffect call in your component. This tells React to execute it later, after rendering, when side effects are allowed. However, this approach should be your last resort. When possible, try to express your logic with rendering alone. You’ll be surprised how far this can take you! Deep Dive Why does React care about purity? Show Details Writing pure functions takes some habit and discipline. But it also unlocks marvelous opportunities: Your components could run in a different environment—for example, on the server! Since they return the same result for the same inputs, one component can serve many user requests. You can improve performance by skipping rendering components whose inputs have not changed. This is safe because pure functions always return the same results, so they are safe to cache. If some data changes in the middle of rendering a deep component tree, React can restart rendering without wasting time to finish the outdated render. Purity makes it safe to stop calculating at any time. Every new React feature we’re building takes advantage of purity. From data fetching to animations to performance, keeping components pure unlocks the power of the React paradigm. Recap A component must be pure, meaning: It minds its own business. It should not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering. Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX. Rendering can happen at any time, so components should not depend on each others’ rendering sequence. You should not mutate any of the inputs that your components use for rendering.

Learn React Describing the UI Understanding Your UI as a Tree Your React app is taking shape with many components being nested within each other. How does React keep track of your app’s component structure? React, and many other UI libraries, model UI as a tree.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='what it is useful for What a module dependency tree is and what it is useful for Your UI as a tree Trees are a relationship model between items and UI is often represented using tree structures. For example, browsers use tree structures to model HTML ( DOM ) and CSS ( CSSOM ). Mobile platforms also use trees to represent their view hierarchy. React creates a UI tree from your components. In this example, the UI tree is then used to render to the DOM. Like browsers and mobile platforms, React also uses tree structures to manage and model the relationship between components in a React app. These trees are useful tools to understand how data flows through a React app and how to optimize rendering and app size. The Render Tree A major feature of components is the ability to compose components of other components. As we nest components , we have the concept of parent and child components, where each parent component may itself be a child of another component. When we render a React app, we can model this relationship in a tree, known as the render tree. Here is a React app that renders inspirational quotes. App.js FancyText.js InspirationGenerator.js Copyright.js quotes.js App.js Reset Fork import FancyText from \\'./FancyText\\'; import InspirationGenerator from \\'./InspirationGenerator\\'; import Copyright from \\'./Copyright\\'; export default function App() { return ( <> <FancyText title text=\"Get Inspired App\" /> <InspirationGenerator> <Copyright year={2004} /> </InspirationGenerator> </> ); } React creates a render tree , a UI tree, composed of the rendered components. From the example app, we can construct the above render tree. The tree is composed of nodes, each of which represents a component. App , FancyText , Copyright , to name a few, are all nodes in our tree. The root node in a React render tree is the root component of the app. In this case, the root component is App and it is the first component React renders.

Each arrow in the tree points from a parent component to a child component. Deep Dive Where are the HTML tags in the render tree? Show Details You’ll notice in the above render tree, there is no mention of the HTML tags that each component renders. This is because the render tree is only composed of React components . React, as a UI framework, is platform agnostic. On react.dev, we showcase examples that render to the web, which uses HTML markup as its UI primitives. But a React app could just as likely render to a mobile or desktop platform, which may use different UI primitives like UIView or FrameworkElement . These platform UI primitives are not a part of React. React render trees can provide insight to our React app regardless of what platform your app renders to. A render tree represents a single render pass of a React application. With conditional rendering , a parent component may render different children depending on the data passed. We can update the app to conditionally render either an inspirational quote or color. App.js FancyText.js Color.js InspirationGenerator.js Copyright.js inspirations.js App.js Reset Fork import FancyText from \\'./FancyText\\'; import InspirationGenerator from \\'./InspirationGenerator\\'; import Copyright from \\'./Copyright\\'; export default function App() { return ( <> <FancyText title text=\"Get Inspired App\" /> <InspirationGenerator> <Copyright year={2004} /> </InspirationGenerator> </> ); } With conditional rendering, across different renders, the render tree may render different components. In this example, depending on what inspiration.type is, we may render <FancyText> or <Color> . The render tree may be different for each render pass.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='tree may be different for each render pass. Although render trees may differ across render passes, these trees are generally helpful for identifying what the top-level and leaf components are in a React app. Top-level components are the components nearest to the root component and affect the rendering performance of all the components beneath them and often contain the most complexity. Leaf components are near the bottom of the tree and have no child components and are often frequently re-rendered. Identifying these categories of components are useful for understanding data flow and performance of your app. The Module Dependency Tree Another relationship in a React app that can be modeled with a tree are an app’s module dependencies. As we break up our components and logic into separate files, we create JS modules where we may export components, functions, or constants. Each node in a module dependency tree is a module and each branch represents an import statement in that module. If we take the previous Inspirations app, we can build a module dependency tree, or dependency tree for short. The module dependency tree for the Inspirations app. The root node of the tree is the root module, also known as the entrypoint file. It often is the module that contains the root component. Comparing to the render tree of the same app, there are similar structures but some notable differences: The nodes that make-up the tree represent modules, not components. Non-component modules, like inspirations.js , are also represented in this tree. The render tree only encapsulates components. Copyright.js appears under App.js but in the render tree, Copyright , the component, appears as a child of InspirationGenerator . This is because InspirationGenerator accepts JSX as children props , so it renders Copyright as a child component but does not import the module.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=', so it renders Copyright as a child component but does not import the module. Dependency trees are useful to determine what modules are necessary to run your React app. When building a React app for production, there is typically a build step that will bundle all the necessary JavaScript to ship to the client. The tool responsible for this is called a bundler , and bundlers will use the dependency tree to determine what modules should be included. As your app grows, often the bundle size does too. Large bundle sizes are expensive for a client to download and run. Large bundle sizes can delay the time for your UI to get drawn. Getting a sense of your app’s dependency tree may help with debugging these issues. Recap Trees are a common way to represent the relationship between entities. They are often used to model UI. Render trees represent the nested relationship between React components across a single render. With conditional rendering, the render tree may change across different renders. With different prop values, components may render different children components. Render trees help identify what the top-level and leaf components are. Top-level components affect the rendering performance of all components beneath them and leaf components are often re-rendered frequently. Identifying them is useful for understanding and debugging rendering performance. Dependency trees represent the module dependencies in a React app. Dependency trees are used by build tools to bundle the necessary code to ship an app. Dependency trees are useful for debugging large bundle sizes that slow time to paint and expose opportunities for optimizing what code is bundled.

Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on. You will learn Different ways to write an event handler How to pass event handling logic from a parent component How events propagate and how to stop them Adding event handlers To add an event handler, you will first define a function and then pass it as a prop to the appropriate JSX tag. For example, here is a button that doesn’t do anything yet: App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function Button() { return ( <button> I don't do anything </button> ); } You can make it show a message\"),\n",

Implement the logic inside that function (use alert to show the message). Add onClick={handleClick} to the <button> JSX. App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function Button() { function handleClick() { alert('You clicked me!'); } return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> Click me </button> ); } You defined the handleClick function and then passed it as a prop to <button> . handleClick is an event handler. Event handler functions: Are usually defined inside your components. Have names that start with handle , followed by the name of the event. By convention, it is common to name event handlers as handle followed by the event name. You’ll often see onClick={handleClick} , onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter} , and so on. Alternatively, you can define an event handler inline in the JSX: <code_snipet> <button onClick={function handleClick() { alert('You clicked me!');}}> </code_snipet> Or, more concisely, using an arrow function: <code_snipet> <button onClick={() => { alert('You clicked me!');}}> </code_snipet> All of these styles are equivalent. Inline event handlers are convenient for short functions. Pitfall Functions passed to event handlers must be passed, not called. For example: passing a function (correct) calling a function (incorrect) <button onClick={handleClick}> <button onClick={handleClick()}> The difference is subtle. In the first example, the handleClick function is passed as an onClick event handler. This tells React to remember it and only call your function when the user clicks the button.

When you write code inline, the same pitfall presents itself in a different way: passing a function (correct) calling a function (incorrect) <button onClick={() => alert(\\'...\\')}> <button onClick={alert(\\'...\\')}> Passing inline code like this won’t fire on click—it fires every time the component renders: <code_snipet> // This alert fires when the component renders, not when clicked!<button onClick={alert(\\'You clicked me!\\')}> </code_snipet> If you want to define your event handler inline, wrap it in an anonymous function like so: <code_snipet> <button onClick={() => alert(\\'You clicked me!\\')}> </code_snipet> Rather than executing the code inside with every render, this creates a function to be called later. In both cases, what you want to pass is a function: <button onClick={handleClick}> passes the handleClick function. <button onClick={() => alert(\\'...\\')}> passes the () => alert(\\'...\\') function.

Consider buttons: depending on where you’re using a Button component, you might want to execute a different function—perhaps one plays a movie and another uploads an image. To do this, pass a prop the component receives from its parent as the event handler like so: App.js App.js Reset Fork function Button({ onClick, children }) { return ( <button onClick={onClick}> {children} </button> ); } function PlayButton({ movieName }) { function handlePlayClick() { alert(`Playing ${movieName}!`); } return ( <Button onClick={handlePlayClick}> Play \"{movieName}\" </Button> ); } function UploadButton() { return ( <Button onClick={() => alert(\\'Uploading!\\')}> Upload Image </Button> ); } export default function Toolbar() { return ( <div> <PlayButton movieName=\"Kiki\\'s Delivery Service\" /> <UploadButton /> </div> ); } Show more Here, the Toolbar component renders a PlayButton and an UploadButton : PlayButton passes handlePlayClick as the onClick prop to the Button inside. UploadButton passes () => alert(\\'Uploading!\\') as the onClick prop to the Button inside. Finally, your Button component accepts a prop called onClick . It passes that prop directly to the built-in browser <button> with onClick={onClick} . This tells React to call the passed function on click. If you use a design system , it’s common for components like buttons to contain styling but not specify behavior. Instead, components like PlayButton and UploadButton will pass event handlers down. Naming event handler props Built-in components like <button> and <div> only support browser event names like onClick . However, when you’re building your own components, you can name their event handler props any way that you like.

When your component supports multiple interactions, you might name event handler props for app-specific concepts. For example, this Toolbar component receives onPlayMovie and onUploadImage event handlers: App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function App() { return ( <Toolbar onPlayMovie={() => alert('Playing!')} onUploadImage={() => alert('Uploading!')} /> ); } function Toolbar({ onPlayMovie, onUploadImage }) { return ( <div> <Button onClick={onPlayMovie}> Play Movie </Button> <Button onClick={onUploadImage}> Upload Image </Button> </div> ); } function Button({ onClick, children }) { return ( <button onClick={onClick}> {children} </button> ); } Show more Notice how the App component does not need to know what Toolbar will do with onPlayMovie or onUploadImage .

For example, to handle clicks, use <button onClick={handleClick}> instead of <div onClick={handleClick}> . Using a real browser <button> enables built-in browser behaviors like keyboard navigation. If you don’t like the default browser styling of a button and want to make it look more like a link or a different UI element, you can achieve it with CSS. Learn more about writing accessible markup. Event propagation Event handlers will also catch events from any children your component might have. We say that an event “bubbles” or “propagates” up the tree: it starts with where the event happened, and then goes up the tree. This <div> contains two buttons. Both the <div> and each button have their own onClick handlers. Which handlers do you think will fire when you click a button? App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function Toolbar() { return ( <div className=\"Toolbar\" onClick={() => { alert(\\'You clicked on the toolbar!\\'); }}> <button onClick={() => alert(\\'Playing!\\')}> Play Movie </button> <button onClick={() => alert(\\'Uploading!\\')}> Upload Image </button> </div> ); } If you click on either button, its onClick will run first, followed by the parent <div> ’s onClick . So two messages will appear. If you click the toolbar itself, only the parent <div> ’s onClick will run. Pitfall All events propagate in React except onScroll , which only works on the JSX tag you attach it to. Stopping propagation Event handlers receive an event object as their only argument. By convention, it’s usually called e , which stands for “event”. You can use this object to read information about the event. That event object also lets you stop the propagation. If you want to prevent an event from reaching parent components, you need to call e.stopPropagation() like this Button component does: App.js App.js Reset Fork function Button({ onClick, children }) { return ( <button onClick={e => {'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='reaching parent components, you need to call e.stopPropagation() like this Button component does: App.js App.js Reset Fork function Button({ onClick, children }) { return ( <button onClick={e => { e.stopPropagation(); onClick(); }}> {children} </button> ); } export default function Toolbar() { return ( <div className=\"Toolbar\" onClick={() => { alert(\\'You clicked on the toolbar!\\'); }}> <Button onClick={() => alert(\\'Playing!\\')}> Play Movie </Button> <Button onClick={() => alert(\\'Uploading!\\')}> Upload Image </Button> </div> ); } Show more When you click on a button: React calls the onClick handler passed to <button> . That handler, defined in Button , does the following: Calls e.stopPropagation() , preventing the event from bubbling further. Calls the onClick function, which is a prop passed from the Toolbar component. That function, defined in the Toolbar component, displays the button’s own alert. Since the propagation was stopped, the parent <div> ’s onClick handler does not run. As a result of e.stopPropagation() , clicking on the buttons now only shows a single alert (from the <button> ) rather than the two of them (from the <button> and the parent toolbar <div> ). Clicking a button is not the same thing as clicking the surrounding toolbar, so stopping the propagation makes sense for this UI. Deep Dive Capture phase events Show Details In rare cases, you might need to catch all events on child elements, even if they stopped propagation . For example, maybe you want to log every click to analytics, regardless of the propagation logic. You can do this by adding Capture at the end of the event name: <code_snipet> <div onClickCapture={() => { /* this runs first */ }}> <button onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()} /> <button onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()} /></div> </code_snipet> Each event propagates in three phases: It travels down, calling all onClickCapture handlers. It runs the clicked element’s onClick handler. It travels upwards, calling all onClick handlers.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Each event propagates in three phases: It travels down, calling all onClickCapture handlers. It runs the clicked element’s onClick handler. It travels upwards, calling all onClick handlers. Capture events are useful for code like routers or analytics, but you probably won’t use them in app code. Passing handlers as alternative to propagation Notice how this click handler runs a line of code and then calls the onClick prop passed by the parent: <code_snipet> function Button({ onClick, children }) { return ( <button onClick={e => { e.stopPropagation(); onClick(); }}> {children} </button> );} </code_snipet> You could add more code to this handler before calling the parent onClick event handler, too. This pattern provides an alternative to propagation. It lets the child component handle the event, while also letting the parent component specify some additional behavior. Unlike propagation, it’s not automatic. But the benefit of this pattern is that you can clearly follow the whole chain of code that executes as a result of some event. If you rely on propagation and it’s difficult to trace which handlers execute and why, try this approach instead. Preventing default behavior Some browser events have default behavior associated with them. For example, a <form> submit event, which happens when a button inside of it is clicked, will reload the whole page by default: App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function Signup() { return ( <form onSubmit={() => alert('Submitting!')}> <input /> <button>Send</button> </form> ); } You can call e.preventDefault() on the event object to stop this from happening: App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function Signup() { return ( <form onSubmit={e => { e.preventDefault(); alert('Submitting!'); }}> <input /> <button>Send</button> </form> ); } Don’t confuse e.stopPropagation() and e.preventDefault() . They are both useful, but are unrelated: e.stopPropagation() stops the event handlers attached to the tags above from firing.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='</form> ); } Don’t confuse e.stopPropagation() and e.preventDefault() . They are both useful, but are unrelated: e.stopPropagation() stops the event handlers attached to the tags above from firing. e.preventDefault() prevents the default browser behavior for the few events that have it. Can event handlers have side effects? Absolutely! Event handlers are the best place for side effects. Unlike rendering functions, event handlers don’t need to be pure , so it’s a great place to change something—for example, change an input’s value in response to typing, or change a list in response to a button press. However, in order to change some information, you first need some way to store it. In React, this is done by using state, a component’s memory. You will learn all about it on the next page. Recap You can handle events by passing a function as a prop to an element like <button> . Event handlers must be passed, not called! onClick={handleClick} , not onClick={handleClick()} . You can define an event handler function separately or inline. Event handlers are defined inside a component, so they can access props. You can declare an event handler in a parent and pass it as a prop to a child. You can define your own event handler props with application-specific names. Events propagate upwards. Call e.stopPropagation() on the first argument to prevent that. Events may have unwanted default browser behavior. Call e.preventDefault() to prevent that. Explicitly calling an event handler prop from a child handler is a good alternative to propagation. Try out some challenges 1 . Fix an event handler 2 .

Learn React Adding Interactivity State: A Component's Memory Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state .

Clicking the “Next” button should show the next sculpture by changing the index to 1 , then 2 , and so on. However, this won’t work (you can try it!): App.js data.js App.js Reset Fork import { sculptureList } from './data.js'; export default function Gallery() { let index = 0; function handleClick() { index = index + 1; } let sculpture = sculptureList[index]; return ( <> <button onClick={handleClick}> Next </button> <h2> <i>{sculpture.name} </i> by {sculpture.artist} </h2> <h3> ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length}) </h3> <img src={sculpture.url} alt={sculpture.alt} /> <p> {sculpture.description} </p> </> ); } Show more The handleClick event handler is updating a local variable, index . But two things prevent that change from being visible: Local variables don’t persist between renders. When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables. Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders. React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data. To update a component with new data, two things need to happen: Retain the data between renders. Trigger React to render the component with new data (re-rendering). The useState Hook provides those two things: A state variable to retain the data between renders. A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again. Adding a state variable To add a state variable, import useState from React at the top of the file: <code_snipet> import { useState } from 'react'; </code_snipet> Then, replace this line: <code_snipet> let index = 0; </code_snipet> with <code_snipet> const [index, setIndex] = useState(0); </code_snipet> index is a state variable and setIndex is\"),\n",

The [ and ] syntax here is called array destructuring and it lets you read values from an array. The array returned by useState always has exactly two items. This is how they work together in handleClick : <code_snipet> function handleClick() { setIndex(index + 1);} </code_snipet> Now clicking the “Next” button switches the current sculpture: App.js data.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; import { sculptureList } from './data.js'; export default function Gallery() { const [index, setIndex] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setIndex(index + 1); } let sculpture = sculptureList[index]; return ( <> <button onClick={handleClick}> Next </button> <h2> <i>{sculpture.name} </i> by {sculpture.artist} </h2> <h3> ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length}) </h3> <img src={sculpture.url} alt={sculpture.alt} /> <p> {sculpture.description} </p> </> ); } Show more Meet your first Hook In React, useState , as well as any other function starting with “ use ”, is called a Hook. Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering (which we’ll get into in more detail on the next page). They let you “hook into” different React features. State is just one of those features, but you will meet the other Hooks later. Pitfall Hooks—functions starting with use —can only be called at the top level of your components or your own Hooks. You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it’s helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component’s needs.

Anatomy of useState When you call useState , you are telling React that you want this component to remember something: <code_snipet> const [index, setIndex] = useState(0); </code_snipet> In this case, you want React to remember index . Note The convention is to name this pair like const [something, setSomething] . You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects. The only argument to useState is the initial value of your state variable. In this example, the index ’s initial value is set to 0 with useState(0) . Every time your component renders, useState gives you an array containing two values: The state variable ( index ) with the value you stored. The state setter function ( setIndex ) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again. Here’s how that happens in action: <code_snipet> const [index, setIndex] = useState(0); </code_snipet> Your component renders the first time. Because you passed 0 to useState as the initial value for index , it will return [0, setIndex] . React remembers 0 is the latest state value. You update the state. When a user clicks the button, it calls setIndex(index + 1) . index is 0 , so it’s setIndex(1) . This tells React to remember index is 1 now and triggers another render. Your component’s second render. React still sees useState(0) , but because React remembers that you set index to 1 , it returns [1, setIndex] instead. And so on! Giving a component multiple state variables You can have as many state variables of as many types as you like in one component. This component has two state variables, a number index and a boolean showMore that’s toggled when you click “Show details”: App.js data.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; import { sculptureList } from './data.js'; export default function Gallery() { const [index, setIndex] =\"),\n",

But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it’s more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read Choosing the State Structure for more tips. Deep Dive How does React know which state to return? Show Details You might have noticed that the useState call does not receive any information about which state variable it refers to. There is no “identifier” that is passed to useState , so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no. Instead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component. This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above (“only call Hooks at the top level”), Hooks will always be called in the same order.

Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to 0 before rendering.

State is isolated and private State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state! Changing one of them will not affect the other. In this example, the Gallery component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent: App.js Gallery.js data.js App.js Reset Fork import Gallery from \\'./Gallery.js\\'; export default function Page() { return ( <div className=\"Page\"> <Gallery /> <Gallery /> </div> ); } This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it’s “local” to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two <Gallery /> components, so their state is stored separately. Also notice how the Page component doesn’t “know” anything about the Gallery state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, state is fully private to the component declaring it. The parent component can’t change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components. What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync?

The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in Sharing State Between Components. Recap Use a state variable when a component needs to “remember” some information between renders. State variables are declared by calling the useState Hook. Hooks are special functions that start with use . They let you “hook into” React features like state. Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including useState , is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook. The useState Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it. You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order. State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state. Try out some challenges 1 . Complete the gallery 2 . Fix stuck form inputs 3 . Fix a crash 4 . Remove unnecessary state Challenge 1 of 4 : Complete the gallery When you press “Next” on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible. After fixing the crash, add a “Previous” button that shows the previous sculpture.

You will learn What rendering means in React When and why React renders a component The steps involved in displaying a component on screen Why rendering does not always produce a DOM update Imagine that your components are cooks in the kitchen, assembling tasty dishes from ingredients. In this scenario, React is the waiter who puts in requests from customers and brings them their orders.

This process of requesting and serving UI has three steps: Triggering a render (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen) Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen) Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table) Trigger Render Commit Illustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors Step 1: Trigger a render There are two reasons for a component to render: It’s the component’s initial render. The component’s (or one of its ancestors’) state has been updated. Initial render When your app starts, you need to trigger the initial render. Frameworks and sandboxes sometimes hide this code, but it’s done by calling createRoot with the target DOM node, and then calling its render method with your component: index.js Image.js index.js Reset Fork import Image from './Image.js'; import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'; const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')) root.render(<Image />); Try commenting out the root.render() call and see the component disappear! Re-renders when state updates Once the component has been initially rendered, you can trigger further renders by updating its state with the set function. Updating your component’s state automatically queues a render. (You can imagine these as a restaurant guest ordering tea, dessert, and all sorts of things after putting in their first order, depending on the state of their thirst or hunger.) State update... ...triggers... ...render! Illustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors Step 2: React renders your components After you trigger a render, React calls your components to figure out what to display on screen. “Rendering” is React calling your components. On initial render, React will call the root component. For subsequent renders, React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render. This process is recursive: if the updated component returns some other component, React will render that\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='renders, React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render. This process is recursive: if the updated component returns some other component, React will render that component next, and if that component also returns something, it will render that component next, and so on. The process will continue until there are no more nested components and React knows exactly what should be displayed on screen. In the following example, React will call Gallery() and Image() several times: index.js Gallery.js Gallery.js Reset Fork export default function Gallery() { return ( <section> <h1>Inspiring Sculptures</h1> <Image /> <Image /> <Image /> </section> ); } function Image() { return ( <img src=\" alt=\"\\'Floralis Genérica\\' by Eduardo Catalano: a gigantic metallic flower sculpture with reflective petals\" /> ); } Show more During the initial render, React will create the DOM nodes for <section> , <h1> , and three <img> tags. During a re-render, React will calculate which of their properties, if any, have changed since the previous render. It won’t do anything with that information until the next step, the commit phase. Pitfall Rendering must always be a pure calculation : Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX. (When someone orders a salad with tomatoes, they should not receive a salad with onions!) It minds its own business. It should not change any objects or variables that existed before rendering. (One order should not change anyone else’s order.) Otherwise, you can encounter confusing bugs and unpredictable behavior as your codebase grows in complexity. When developing in “Strict Mode”, React calls each component’s function twice, which can help surface mistakes caused by impure functions.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Optimizing performance Show Details The default behavior of rendering all components nested within the updated component is not optimal for performance if the updated component is very high in the tree. If you run into a performance issue, there are several opt-in ways to solve it described in the Performance section. Don’t optimize prematurely! Step 3: React commits changes to the DOM After rendering (calling) your components, React will modify the DOM. For the initial render, React will use the appendChild() DOM API to put all the DOM nodes it has created on screen. For re-renders, React will apply the minimal necessary operations (calculated while rendering!) to make the DOM match the latest rendering output. React only changes the DOM nodes if there’s a difference between renders. For example, here is a component that re-renders with different props passed from its parent every second. Notice how you can add some text into the <input> , updating its value , but the text doesn’t disappear when the component re-renders: Clock.js Clock.js Reset Fork export default function Clock({ time }) { return ( <> <h1>{time}</h1> <input /> </> ); } This works because during this last step, React only updates the content of <h1> with the new time . It sees that the <input> appears in the JSX in the same place as last time, so React doesn’t touch the <input> —or its value ! Epilogue: Browser paint After rendering is done and React updated the DOM, the browser will repaint the screen. Although this process is known as “browser rendering”, we’ll refer to it as “painting” to avoid confusion throughout the docs.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='as changing directly in response to the user event like a click. In React, it works a little differently from this mental model. On the previous page, you saw that setting state requests a re-render from React. This means that for an interface to react to the event, you need to update the state . In this example, when you press “send”, setIsSent(true) tells React to re-render the UI: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function Form() { const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false); const [message, setMessage] = useState(\\'Hi!\\'); if (isSent) { return <h1>Your message is on its way!</h1> } return ( <form onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); setIsSent(true); sendMessage(message); }}> <textarea placeholder=\"Message\" value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} /> <button type=\"submit\">Send</button> </form> ); } function sendMessage(message) { // ... } Show more Here’s what happens when you click the button: The onSubmit event handler executes. setIsSent(true) sets isSent to true and queues a new render. React re-renders the component according to the new isSent value. Let’s take a closer look at the relationship between state and rendering. Rendering takes a snapshot in time “Rendering” means that React is calling your component, which is a function. The JSX you return from that function is like a snapshot of the UI in time. Its props, event handlers, and local variables were all calculated using its state at the time of the render. Unlike a photograph or a movie frame, the UI “snapshot” you return is interactive. It includes logic like event handlers that specify what happens in response to inputs. React updates the screen to match this snapshot and connects the event handlers. As a result, pressing a button will trigger the click handler from your JSX. When React re-renders a component: React calls your function again. Your function returns a new JSX snapshot.

React executing the function Calculating the snapshot Updating the DOM tree Illustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors As a component’s memory, state is not like a regular variable that disappears after your function returns. State actually “lives” in React itself—as if on a shelf!—outside of your function. When React calls your component, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render. Your component returns a snapshot of the UI with a fresh set of props and event handlers in its JSX, all calculated using the state values from that render! You tell React to update the state React updates the state value React passes a snapshot of the state value into the component Illustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors Here’s a little experiment to show you how this works. In this example, you might expect that clicking the “+3” button would increment the counter three times because it calls setNumber(number + 1) three times. See what happens when you click the “+3” button: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Counter() { const [number, setNumber] = useState(0); return ( <> <h1>{number}</h1> <button onClick={() => { setNumber(number + 1); setNumber(number + 1); setNumber(number + 1); }}>+3</button> </> ) } Show more Notice that number only increments once per click! Setting state only changes it for the next render. During the first render, number was 0 . This is why, in that render’s onClick handler, the value of number is still 0 even after setNumber(number + 1) was called: <code_snipet> <button onClick={() => { setNumber(number + 1); setNumber(number + 1); setNumber(number + 1);}}>+3</button> </code_snipet> Here is what this button’s click handler tells React to do: setNumber(number + 1) : number is 0 so setNumber(0\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"+ 1); setNumber(number + 1); setNumber(number + 1);}}>+3</button> </code_snipet> Here is what this button’s click handler tells React to do: setNumber(number + 1) : number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1) . React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render. setNumber(number + 1) : number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1) . React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render. setNumber(number + 1) : number is 0 so setNumber(0 + 1) . React prepares to change number to 1 on the next render. Even though you called setNumber(number + 1) three times, in this render’s event handler number is always 0 , so you set the state to 1 three times. This is why, after your event handler finishes, React re-renders the component with number equal to 1 rather than 3 . You can also visualize this by mentally substituting state variables with their values in your code. Since the number state variable is 0 for this render , its event handler looks like this: <code_snipet> <button onClick={() => { setNumber(0 + 1); setNumber(0 + 1); setNumber(0 + 1);}}>+3</button> </code_snipet> For the next render, number is 1 , so that render’s click handler looks like this: <code_snipet> <button onClick={() => { setNumber(1 + 1); setNumber(1 + 1); setNumber(1 + 1);}}>+3</button> </code_snipet> This is why clicking the button again will set the counter to 2 , then to 3 on the next click, and so on. State over time Well, that was fun. Try to guess what clicking this button will alert: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Counter() { const [number, setNumber] = useState(0); return ( <> <h1>{number}</h1> <button onClick={() => { setNumber(number + 5); alert(number); }}>+5</button> </> ) } If you use the substitution method from before, you can guess that the alert shows “0”: <code_snipet> setNumber(0 + 5);alert(0); </code_snipet> But what if you put a timer on the alert, so it only fires after the component re-rendered? Would it say “0” or “5”? Have a guess! App.js\"),\n",

App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Counter() { const [number, setNumber] = useState(0); return ( <> <h1>{number}</h1> <button onClick={() => { setNumber(number + 5); setTimeout(() => { alert(number); }, 3000); }}>+5</button> </> ) } Show more Surprised? If you use the substitution method, you can see the “snapshot” of the state passed to the alert. <code_snipet> setNumber(0 + 5);setTimeout(() => { alert(0);}, 3000); </code_snipet> The state stored in React may have changed by the time the alert runs, but it was scheduled using a snapshot of the state at the time the user interacted with it! A state variable’s value never changes within a render, even if its event handler’s code is asynchronous. Inside that render’s onClick , the value of number continues to be 0 even after setNumber(number + 5) was called. Its value was “fixed” when React “took the snapshot” of the UI by calling your component. Here is an example of how that makes your event handlers less prone to timing mistakes. Below is a form that sends a message with a five-second delay. Imagine this scenario: You press the “Send” button, sending “Hello” to Alice. Before the five-second delay ends, you change the value of the “To” field to “Bob”. What do you expect the alert to display? Would it display, “You said Hello to Alice”? Or would it display, “You said Hello to Bob”? Make a guess based on what you know, and then try it: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Form() { const [to, setTo] = useState('Alice'); const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello'); function handleSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); setTimeout(() => { alert(`You said ${message} to ${to}`); }, 5000); } return ( <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> <label> To:{'\"),\n",

You don’t need to worry whether the state has changed while the code is running. But what if you wanted to read the latest state before a re-render? You’ll want to use a state updater function , covered on the next page! Recap Setting state requests a new render. React stores state outside of your component, as if on a shelf. When you call useState , React gives you a snapshot of the state for that render . Variables and event handlers don’t “survive” re-renders. Every render has its own event handlers. Every render (and functions inside it) will always “see” the snapshot of the state that React gave to that render. You can mentally substitute state in event handlers, similarly to how you think about the rendered JSX. Event handlers created in the past have the state values from the render in which they were created. Try out some challenges Challenge 1 of 1 : Implement a traffic light Here is a crosswalk light component that toggles when the button is pressed: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function TrafficLight() { const [walk, setWalk] = useState(true); function handleClick() { setWalk(!walk); } return ( <> <button onClick={handleClick}> Change to {walk ? \\'Stop\\' : \\'Walk\\'} </button> <h1 style={{ color: walk ? \\'darkgreen\\' : \\'darkred\\' }}> {walk ? \\'Walk\\' : \\'Stop\\'} </h1> </> ); } Show more Add an alert to the click handler.

React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates. This is why the re-render only happens after all these setNumber() calls. This might remind you of a waiter taking an order at the restaurant. A waiter doesn’t run to the kitchen at the mention of your first dish! Instead, they let you finish your order, let you make changes to it, and even take orders from other people at the table. Illustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors This lets you update multiple state variables—even from multiple components—without triggering too many re-renders. But this also means that the UI won’t be updated until after your event handler, and any code in it, completes. This behavior, also known as batching, makes your React app run much faster. It also avoids dealing with confusing “half-finished” renders where only some of the variables have been updated. React does not batch across multiple intentional events like clicks —each click is handled separately. Rest assured that React only does batching when it’s generally safe to do. This ensures that, for example, if the first button click disables a form, the second click would not submit it again.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"that, for example, if the first button click disables a form, the second click would not submit it again. Updating the same state multiple times before the next render It is an uncommon use case, but if you would like to update the same state variable multiple times before the next render, instead of passing the next state value like setNumber(number + 1) , you can pass a function that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, like setNumber(n => n + 1) . It is a way to tell React to “do something with the state value” instead of just replacing it. Try incrementing the counter now: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Counter() { const [number, setNumber] = useState(0); return ( <> <h1>{number}</h1> <button onClick={() => { setNumber(n => n + 1); setNumber(n => n + 1); setNumber(n => n + 1); }}>+3</button> </> ) } Show more Here, n => n + 1 is called an updater function. When you pass it to a state setter: React queues this function to be processed after all the other code in the event handler has run. During the next render, React goes through the queue and gives you the final updated state. <code_snipet> setNumber(n => n + 1);setNumber(n => n + 1);setNumber(n => n + 1); </code_snipet> Here’s how React works through these lines of code while executing the event handler: setNumber(n => n + 1) : n => n + 1 is a function.

When you call useState during the next render, React goes through the queue. The previous number state was 0 , so that’s what React passes to the first updater function as the n argument. Then React takes the return value of your previous updater function and passes it to the next updater as n , and so on: queued update n returns n => n + 1 0 0 + 1 = 1 n => n + 1 1 1 + 1 = 2 n => n + 1 2 2 + 1 = 3 React\"),\n",

To summarize, here’s how you can think of what you’re passing to the setNumber state setter: An updater function (e.g. n => n + 1 ) gets added to the queue. Any other value (e.g. number 5 ) adds “replace with 5 ” to the queue, ignoring what’s already queued. After the event handler completes, React will trigger a re-render. During the re-render, React will process the queue. Updater functions run during rendering, so updater functions must be pure and only return the result. Don’t try to set state from inside of them or run other side effects. In Strict Mode, React will run each updater function twice (but discard the second result) to help you find mistakes. Naming conventions It’s common to name the updater function argument by the first letters of the corresponding state variable: <code_snipet> setEnabled(e => !e);setLastName(ln => ln.reverse());setFriendCount(fc => fc * 2); </code_snipet> If you prefer more verbose code, another common convention is to repeat the full state variable name, like setEnabled(enabled => !enabled) , or to use a prefix like setEnabled(prevEnabled => !prevEnabled) .

Learn React Adding Interactivity Updating Objects in State State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn’t change objects that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use that copy. You will learn How to correctly update an object in React state How to update a nested object without mutating it What immutability is, and how not to break it How to make object copying less repetitive with Immer What’s a mutation?

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"less repetitive with Immer What’s a mutation? You can store any kind of JavaScript value in state. <code_snipet> const [x, setX] = useState(0); </code_snipet> So far you’ve been working with numbers, strings, and booleans. These kinds of JavaScript values are “immutable”, meaning unchangeable or “read-only”. You can trigger a re-render to replace a value: <code_snipet> setX(5); </code_snipet> The x state changed from 0 to 5 , but the number 0 itself did not change. It’s not possible to make any changes to the built-in primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript. Now consider an object in state: <code_snipet> const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 }); </code_snipet> Technically, it is possible to change the contents of the object itself . This is called a mutation: <code_snipet> position.x = 5; </code_snipet> However, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them as if they were immutable—like numbers, booleans, and strings. Instead of mutating them, you should always replace them. Treat state as read-only In other words, you should treat any JavaScript object that you put into state as read-only. This example holds an object in state to represent the current pointer position. The red dot is supposed to move when you touch or move the cursor over the preview area. But the dot stays in the initial position: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function MovingDot() { const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 }); return ( <div onPointerMove={e => { position.x = e.clientX; position.y = e.clientY; }} style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100vw', height: '100vh', }}> <div style={{ position: 'absolute', backgroundColor: 'red', borderRadius: '50%', transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`, left: -10, top: -10, width: 20, height: 20, }} /> </div> ); } Show more The problem is with this bit of code. <code_snipet> onPointerMove={e => {\"),\n",

But without using the state setting function, React has no idea that object has changed. So React does not do anything in response. It’s like trying to change the order after you’ve already eaten the meal. While mutating state can work in some cases, we don’t recommend it. You should treat the state value you have access to in a render as read-only. To actually trigger a re-render in this case, create a new object and pass it to the state setting function: <code_snipet> onPointerMove={e => { setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });}} </code_snipet> With setPosition , you’re telling React: Replace position with this new object And render this component again Notice how the red dot now follows your pointer when you touch or hover over the preview area: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function MovingDot() { const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 }); return ( <div onPointerMove={e => { setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY }); }} style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100vw', height: '100vh', }}> <div style={{ position: 'absolute', backgroundColor: 'red', borderRadius: '50%', transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`, left: -10, top: -10, width: 20, height: 20, }} /> </div> ); } Show more Deep Dive Local mutation is fine Show Details Code like this is a problem because it modifies an existing object in state: <code_snipet> position.x = e.clientX;position.y = e.clientY; </code_snipet> But code like this is absolutely fine because you’re mutating a fresh object you have just created : <code_snipet> const nextPosition = {};nextPosition.x = e.clientX;nextPosition.y =\"),\n",

Mutating an object you’ve just created is okay because no other code references it yet. Changing it isn’t going to accidentally impact something that depends on it. This is called a “local mutation”. You can even do local mutation while rendering. Very convenient and completely okay! Copying objects with the spread syntax In the previous example, the position object is always created fresh from the current cursor position. But often, you will want to include existing data as a part of the new object you’re creating. For example, you may want to update only one field in a form, but keep the previous values for all other fields. These input fields don’t work because the onChange handlers mutate the state: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Form() { const [person, setPerson] = useState({ firstName: 'Barbara', lastName: 'Hepworth', email:  }); function handleFirstNameChange(e) { person.firstName = e.target.value; } function handleLastNameChange(e) { person.lastName = e.target.value; } function handleEmailChange(e) { person.email = e.target.value; } return ( <> <label> First name: <input value={person.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} /> </label> <label> Last name: <input value={person.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} /> </label> <label> Email: <input value={person.email} onChange={handleEmailChange} /> </label> <p> {person.firstName}{' '} {person.lastName}{' '} ({person.email}) </p> </> ); } Show more For example, this line mutates the state from a\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"onChange={handleEmailChange} /> </label> <p> {person.firstName}{' '} {person.lastName}{' '} ({person.email}) </p> </> ); } Show more For example, this line mutates the state from a past render: <code_snipet> person.firstName = e.target.value; </code_snipet> The reliable way to get the behavior you’re looking for is to create a new object and pass it to setPerson . But here, you want to also copy the existing data into it because only one of the fields has changed: <code_snipet> setPerson({ firstName: e.target.value, // New first name from the input lastName: person.lastName, email: person.email}); </code_snipet> You can use the ... object spread syntax so that you don’t need to copy every property separately. <code_snipet> setPerson({ ...person, // Copy the old fields firstName: e.target.value // But override this one}); </code_snipet> Now the form works! Notice how you didn’t declare a separate state variable for each input field. For large forms, keeping all data grouped in an object is very convenient—as long as you update it correctly! App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Form() { const [person, setPerson] = useState({ firstName: 'Barbara', lastName: 'Hepworth', email:  }); function handleFirstNameChange(e) { setPerson({ ...person, firstName: e.target.value }); } function handleLastNameChange(e) { setPerson({ ...person, lastName: e.target.value }); } function handleEmailChange(e) { setPerson({ ...person, email: e.target.value }); } return ( <> <label> First name: <input value={person.firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} /> </label> <label> Last name: <input value={person.lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} /> </label> <label> Email: <input value={person.email} onChange={handleEmailChange} /> </label> <p> {person.firstName}{' '} {person.lastName}{' '} ({person.email}) </p> </> ); } Show more Note that the ... spread syntax is “shallow”—it only copies things one level deep.

This makes it fast, but it also means that if you want to update a nested property, you’ll have to use it more than once. Deep Dive Using a single event handler for multiple fields Show Details You can also use the [ and ] braces inside your object definition to specify a property with a dynamic name. Here is the same example, but with a single event handler instead of three different ones: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function Form() { const [person, setPerson] = useState({ firstName: \\'Barbara\\', lastName: \\'Hepworth\\', email:  }); function handleChange(e) { setPerson({ ...person, [e.target.name]: e.target.value }); } return ( <> <label> First name: <input name=\"firstName\" value={person.firstName} onChange={handleChange} /> </label> <label> Last name: <input name=\"lastName\" value={person.lastName} onChange={handleChange} /> </label> <label> Email: <input name=\"email\" value={person.email} onChange={handleChange} /> </label> <p> {person.firstName}{\\' \\'} {person.lastName}{\\' \\'} ({person.email}) </p> </> ); } Show more Here, e.target.name refers to the name property given to the <input> DOM element. Updating a nested object Consider a nested object structure like this: <code_snipet> const [person, setPerson] = useState({ name: \\'Niki de Saint Phalle\\', artwork: { title: \\'Blue Nana\\', city: \\'Hamburg\\', image: \\' }}); </code_snipet> If you wanted to update person.artwork.city , it’s clear how to do it with mutation: <code_snipet> person.artwork.city = \\'New Delhi\\'; </code_snipet> But in React, you treat state as immutable! In order to change city , you would first need to produce the new artwork object (pre-populated with data from the previous one), and then produce the new person object which points at the new artwork : <code_snipet> const nextArtwork = { ...person.artwork, city: \\'New'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"are not really nested Show Details An object like this appears “nested” in code: <code_snipet> let obj = { name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle', artwork: { title: 'Blue Nana', city: 'Hamburg', image: ' }}; </code_snipet> However, “nesting” is an inaccurate way to think about how objects behave. When the code executes, there is no such thing as a “nested” object. You are really looking at two different objects: <code_snipet> let obj1 = { title: 'Blue Nana', city: 'Hamburg', image: ' obj2 = { name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle', artwork: obj1}; </code_snipet> The obj1 object is not “inside” obj2 . For example, obj3 could “point” at obj1 too: <code_snipet> let obj1 = { title: 'Blue Nana', city: 'Hamburg', image: ' obj2 = { name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle', artwork: obj1};let obj3 = { name: 'Copycat', artwork: obj1}; </code_snipet> If you were to mutate obj3.artwork.city , it would affect both obj2.artwork.city and obj1.city . This is because obj3.artwork , obj2.artwork , and obj1 are the same object. This is difficult to see when you think of objects as “nested”. Instead, they are separate objects “pointing” at each other with properties. Write concise update logic with Immer If your state is deeply nested, you might want to consider flattening it. But, if you don’t want to change your state structure, you might prefer a shortcut to nested spreads. Immer is a popular library that lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you. With Immer, the code you write looks like you are “breaking the rules” and mutating an object: <code_snipet> updatePerson(draft => { draft.artwork.city = 'Lagos';}); </code_snipet> But unlike a regular mutation, it doesn’t overwrite the past state!

Under the hood, Immer figures out which parts of the draft have been changed, and produces a completely new object that contains your edits. To try Immer: Run npm install use-immer to add Immer as a dependency Then replace import { useState } from \\'react\\' with import { useImmer } from \\'use-immer\\' Here is the above example converted to Immer: package.json App.js package.json Reset Fork { \"dependencies\": { \"immer\": \"1.7.3\", \"react\": \"latest\", \"react-dom\": \"latest\", \"react-scripts\": \"latest\", \"use-immer\": \"0.5.1\" }, \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"react-scripts start\", \"build\": \"react-scripts build\", \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\", \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\" }, \"devDependencies\": {} } Notice how much more concise the event handlers have become. You can mix and match useState and useImmer in a single component as much as you like. Immer is a great way to keep the update handlers concise, especially if there’s nesting in your state, and copying objects leads to repetitive code. Deep Dive Why is mutating state not recommended in React? Show Details There are a few reasons: Debugging: If you use console.log and don’t mutate state, your past logs won’t get clobbered by the more recent state changes. So you can clearly see how state has changed between renders. Optimizations: Common React optimization strategies rely on skipping work if previous props or state are the same as the next ones. If you never mutate state, it is very fast to check whether there were any changes. If prevObj === obj , you can be sure that nothing could have changed inside of it. New Features: The new React features we’re building rely on state being treated like a snapshot. If you’re mutating past versions of state, that may prevent you from using the new features. Requirement Changes: Some application features, like implementing Undo/Redo, showing a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"like a snapshot. If you’re mutating past versions of state, that may prevent you from using the new features. Requirement Changes: Some application features, like implementing Undo/Redo, showing a history of changes, or letting the user reset a form to earlier values, are easier to do when nothing is mutated. This is because you can keep past copies of state in memory, and reuse them when appropriate. If you start with a mutative approach, features like this can be difficult to add later on. Simpler Implementation: Because React does not rely on mutation, it does not need to do anything special with your objects. It does not need to hijack their properties, always wrap them into Proxies, or do other work at initialization as many “reactive” solutions do. This is also why React lets you put any object into state—no matter how large—without additional performance or correctness pitfalls. In practice, you can often “get away” with mutating state in React, but we strongly advise you not to do that so that you can use new React features developed with this approach in mind. Future contributors and perhaps even your future self will thank you! Recap Treat all state in React as immutable. When you store objects in state, mutating them will not trigger renders and will change the state in previous render “snapshots”. Instead of mutating an object, create a new version of it, and trigger a re-render by setting state to it. You can use the {...obj, something: 'newValue'} object spread syntax to create copies of objects. Spread syntax is shallow: it only copies one level deep. To update a nested object, you need to create copies all the way up from the place you’re updating. To reduce repetitive copying code, use Immer. Try out some challenges 1 .

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"mutation In JavaScript, arrays are just another kind of object. Like with objects , you should treat arrays in React state as read-only. This means that you shouldn’t reassign items inside an array like arr[0] = 'bird' , and you also shouldn’t use methods that mutate the array, such as push() and pop() . Instead, every time you want to update an array, you’ll want to pass a new array to your state setting function. To do that, you can create a new array from the original array in your state by calling its non-mutating methods like filter() and map() . Then you can set your state to the resulting new array. Here is a reference table of common array operations. When dealing with arrays inside React state, you will need to avoid the methods in the left column, and instead prefer the methods in the right column: avoid (mutates the array) prefer (returns a new array) adding push , unshift concat , [...arr] spread syntax ( example ) removing pop , shift , splice filter , slice ( example ) replacing splice , arr[i] = ... assignment map ( example ) sorting reverse , sort copy the array first ( example ) Alternatively, you can use Immer which lets you use methods from both columns. Pitfall Unfortunately, slice and splice are named similarly but are very different: slice lets you copy an array or a part of it. splice mutates the array (to insert or delete items). In React, you will be using slice (no p !) a lot more often because you don’t want to mutate objects or arrays in state. Updating Objects explains what mutation is and why it’s not recommended for state. Adding to an array push() will mutate an array, which you don’t want: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; let nextId = 0; export default function List() { const [name, setName] = useState(''); const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]); return ( <> <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1> <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} /> <button onClick={() => { artists.push({ id: nextId++,\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"[artists, setArtists] = useState([]); return ( <> <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1> <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} /> <button onClick={() => { artists.push({ id: nextId++, name: name, }); }}>Add</button> <ul> {artists.map(artist => ( <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li> ))} </ul> </> ); } Show more Instead, create a new array which contains the existing items and a new item at the end. There are multiple ways to do this, but the easiest one is to use the ... array spread syntax: <code_snipet> setArtists( // Replace the state [ // with a new array ...artists, // that contains all the old items { id: nextId++, name: name } // and one new item at the end ]); </code_snipet> Now it works correctly: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; let nextId = 0; export default function List() { const [name, setName] = useState(''); const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]); return ( <> <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1> <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} /> <button onClick={() => { setArtists([ ...artists, { id: nextId++, name: name } ]); }}>Add</button> <ul> {artists.map(artist => ( <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li> ))} </ul> </> ); } Show more The array spread syntax also lets you prepend an item by placing it before the original ...artists : <code_snipet> setArtists([ { id: nextId++, name: name }, ...artists // Put old items at the end]); </code_snipet> In this way, spread can do the job of both push() by adding to the end of an array and unshift() by adding to the beginning of an array. Try it in the sandbox above! Removing from an array The easiest way to remove an item from an array is to filter it out . In other words, you will produce a new array that will not contain that item. To do this, use the filter method, for example: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; let initialArtists = [ { id: 0, name: 'Marta Colvin Andrade' }, { id: 1, name: 'Lamidi Olonade Fakeye'}, { id: 2,\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"method, for example: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; let initialArtists = [ { id: 0, name: 'Marta Colvin Andrade' }, { id: 1, name: 'Lamidi Olonade Fakeye'}, { id: 2, name: 'Louise Nevelson'}, ]; export default function List() { const [artists, setArtists] = useState( initialArtists ); return ( <> <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1> <ul> {artists.map(artist => ( <li key={artist.id}> {artist.name}{' '} <button onClick={() => { setArtists( artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id ) ); }}> Delete </button> </li> ))} </ul> </> ); } Show more Click the “Delete” button a few times, and look at its click handler. <code_snipet> setArtists( artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id)); </code_snipet> Here, artists.filter(a => a.id !== artist.id) means “create an array that consists of those artists whose IDs are different from artist.id ”. In other words, each artist’s “Delete” button will filter that artist out of the array, and then request a re-render with the resulting array. Note that filter does not modify the original array. Transforming an array If you want to change some or all items of the array, you can use map() to create a new array. The function you will pass to map can decide what to do with each item, based on its data or its index (or both). In this example, an array holds coordinates of two circles and a square. When you press the button, it moves only the circles down by 50 pixels. It does this by producing a new array of data using map() : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; let initialShapes = [ { id: 0, type: 'circle', x: 50, y: 100 }, { id: 1, type: 'square', x: 150, y: 100 }, { id: 2, type: 'circle', x: 250, y: 100 }, ]; export default function ShapeEditor() { const [shapes, setShapes] = useState( initialShapes ); function handleClick() { const nextShapes = shapes.map(shape => { if (shape.type === 'square') { // No change return shape; } else { // Return a new circle 50px below return { ...shape, y: shape.y + 50,\"),\n",

'50%' : '', width: 20, height: 20, }} /> ))} </> ); } Show more Replacing items in an array It is particularly common to want to replace one or more items in an array. Assignments like arr[0] = 'bird' are mutating the original array, so instead you’ll want to use map for this as well. To replace an item, create a new array with map . Inside your map call, you will receive the item index as the second argument. Use it to decide whether to return the original item (the first argument) or something else: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; let initialCounters = [ 0, 0, 0 ]; export default function CounterList() { const [counters, setCounters] = useState( initialCounters ); function handleIncrementClick(index) { const nextCounters = counters.map((c, i) => { if (i === index) { // Increment the clicked counter return c + 1; } else { // The rest haven't changed return c; } }); setCounters(nextCounters); } return ( <ul> {counters.map((counter, i) => ( <li key={i}> {counter} <button onClick={() => { handleIncrementClick(i); }}>+1</button> </li> ))} </ul> ); } Show more Inserting into an array Sometimes, you may want to insert an item at a particular position that’s neither at the beginning nor at the end.

In this example, the Insert button always inserts at the index 1 : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; let nextId = 3; const initialArtists = [ { id: 0, name: 'Marta Colvin Andrade' }, { id: 1, name: 'Lamidi Olonade Fakeye'}, { id: 2, name: 'Louise Nevelson'}, ]; export default function List() { const [name, setName] = useState(''); const [artists, setArtists] = useState( initialArtists ); function handleClick() { const insertAt = 1; // Could be any index const nextArtists = [ // Items before the insertion point: ...artists.slice(0, insertAt), // New item: { id: nextId++, name: name }, // Items after the insertion point: ...artists.slice(insertAt) ]; setArtists(nextArtists); setName(''); } return ( <> <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1> <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} /> <button onClick={handleClick}> Insert </button> <ul> {artists.map(artist => ( <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li> ))} </ul> </> ); } Show more Making other changes to an array There are some things you can’t do with the spread syntax and non-mutating methods like map() and filter() alone. For example, you may want to reverse or sort an array. The JavaScript reverse() and sort() methods are mutating the original array, so you can’t use them directly. However, you can copy the array first, and then make changes to it. For example: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; const initialList = [ { id: 0, title: 'Big Bellies' }, { id: 1, title: 'Lunar Landscape' }, { id: 2, title: 'Terracotta Army' }, ]; export default function List() { const [list, setList] = useState(initialList); function handleClick() { const nextList = [...list]; nextList.reverse(); setList(nextList); } return ( <> <button\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='}, ]; export default function List() { const [list, setList] = useState(initialList); function handleClick() { const nextList = [...list]; nextList.reverse(); setList(nextList); } return ( <> <button onClick={handleClick}> Reverse </button> <ul> {list.map(artwork => ( <li key={artwork.id}>{artwork.title}</li> ))} </ul> </> ); } Show more Here, you use the [...list] spread syntax to create a copy of the original array first. Now that you have a copy, you can use mutating methods like nextList.reverse() or nextList.sort() , or even assign individual items with nextList[0] = \"something\" . However, even if you copy an array, you can’t mutate existing items inside of it directly. This is because copying is shallow—the new array will contain the same items as the original one. So if you modify an object inside the copied array, you are mutating the existing state. For example, code like this is a problem. <code_snipet> const nextList = [...list];nextList[0].seen = true; // Problem: mutates list[0]setList(nextList); </code_snipet> Although nextList and list are two different arrays, nextList[0] and list[0] point to the same object. So by changing nextList[0].seen , you are also changing list[0].seen . This is a state mutation, which you should avoid! You can solve this issue in a similar way to updating nested JavaScript objects —by copying individual items you want to change instead of mutating them. Here’s how. Updating objects inside arrays Objects are not really located “inside” arrays. They might appear to be “inside” in code, but each object in an array is a separate value, to which the array “points”. This is why you need to be careful when changing nested fields like list[0] . Another person’s artwork list may point to the same element of the array! When updating nested state, you need to create copies from the point where you want to update, and all the way up to the top level. Let’s see how this works.

In this example, two separate artwork lists have the same initial state. They are supposed to be isolated, but because of a mutation, their state is accidentally shared, and checking a box in one list affects the other list: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; let nextId = 3; const initialList = [ { id: 0, title: \\'Big Bellies\\', seen: false }, { id: 1, title: \\'Lunar Landscape\\', seen: false }, { id: 2, title: \\'Terracotta Army\\', seen: true }, ]; export default function BucketList() { const [myList, setMyList] = useState(initialList); const [yourList, setYourList] = useState( initialList ); function handleToggleMyList(artworkId, nextSeen) { const myNextList = [...myList]; const artwork = myNextList.find( a => a.id === artworkId ); artwork.seen = nextSeen; setMyList(myNextList); } function handleToggleYourList(artworkId, nextSeen) { const yourNextList = [...yourList]; const artwork = yourNextList.find( a => a.id === artworkId ); artwork.seen = nextSeen; setYourList(yourNextList); } return ( <> <h1>Art Bucket List</h1> <h2>My list of art to see:</h2> <ItemList artworks={myList} onToggle={handleToggleMyList} /> <h2>Your list of art to see:</h2> <ItemList artworks={yourList} onToggle={handleToggleYourList} /> </> ); } function ItemList({ artworks, onToggle }) { return ( <ul> {artworks.map(artwork => ( <li key={artwork.id}> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={artwork.seen} onChange={e => { onToggle( artwork.id, e.target.checked ); }} /> {artwork.title} </label> </li> ))} </ul> ); } Show more The problem is in code like this: <code_snipet> const myNextList = [...myList];const artwork = myNextList.find(a => a.id === artworkId);artwork.seen = nextSeen; // Problem: mutates an existing itemsetMyList(myNextList); </code_snipet> Although the myNextList array itself is new, the items themselves are the same as in the'),\n",

So changing artwork.seen changes the original artwork item. That artwork item is also in yourList , which causes the bug. Bugs like this can be difficult to think about, but thankfully they disappear if you avoid mutating state. You can use map to substitute an old item with its updated version without mutation. <code_snipet> setMyList(myList.map(artwork => { if (artwork.id === artworkId) { // Create a *new* object with changes return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen }; } else { // No changes return artwork; }})); </code_snipet> Here, ... is the object spread syntax used to create a copy of an object.

If you were inserting a new artwork, you could mutate it, but if you’re dealing with something that’s already in state, you need to make a copy. Write concise update logic with Immer Updating nested arrays without mutation can get a little bit repetitive. Just as with objects : Generally, you shouldn’t need to update state more than a couple of levels deep. If your state objects are very deep, you might want to restructure them differently so that they are flat. If you don’t want to change your state structure, you might prefer to use Immer , which lets you write using the convenient but mutating syntax and takes care of producing the copies for you. Here is the Art Bucket List example rewritten with Immer: package.json App.js package.json Reset Fork { \"dependencies\": { \"immer\": \"1.7.3\", \"react\": \"latest\", \"react-dom\": \"latest\", \"react-scripts\": \"latest\", \"use-immer\": \"0.5.1\" }, \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"react-scripts start\", \"build\": \"react-scripts build\", \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\", \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\" }, \"devDependencies\": {} } Note how with Immer, mutation like artwork.seen = nextSeen is now okay: <code_snipet> updateMyTodos(draft => { const artwork = draft.find(a => a.id === artworkId); artwork.seen = nextSeen;}); </code_snipet> This is because you’re not mutating the original state, but you’re mutating a special draft object provided by Immer. Similarly,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"=> a.id === artworkId); artwork.seen = nextSeen;}); </code_snipet> This is because you’re not mutating the original state, but you’re mutating a special draft object provided by Immer. Similarly, you can apply mutating methods like push() and pop() to the content of the draft . Behind the scenes, Immer always constructs the next state from scratch according to the changes that you’ve done to the draft . This keeps your event handlers very concise without ever mutating state. Recap You can put arrays into state, but you can’t change them. Instead of mutating an array, create a new version of it, and update the state to it. You can use the [...arr, newItem] array spread syntax to create arrays with new items. You can use filter() and map() to create new arrays with filtered or transformed items. You can use Immer to keep your code concise. Try out some challenges 1 .

Learn React Managing State Reacting to Input with State React provides a declarative way to manipulate the UI. Instead of manipulating individual pieces of the UI directly, you describe the different states that your component can be in, and switch between them in response to the user input. This is similar to how designers think about the UI. You will learn How declarative UI programming differs from imperative UI programming How to enumerate the different visual states your component can be in How to trigger the changes between the different visual states from code How declarative UI compares to imperative When you design UI interactions, you probably think about how the UI changes in response to user actions.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"the different visual states from code How declarative UI compares to imperative When you design UI interactions, you probably think about how the UI changes in response to user actions. Consider a form that lets the user submit an answer: When you type something into the form, the “Submit” button becomes enabled. When you press “Submit”, both the form and the button become disabled, and a spinner appears. If the network request succeeds, the form gets hidden, and the “Thank you” message appears. If the network request fails, an error message appears, and the form becomes enabled again. In imperative programming, the above corresponds directly to how you implement interaction. You have to write the exact instructions to manipulate the UI depending on what just happened. Here’s another way to think about this: imagine riding next to someone in a car and telling them turn by turn where to go. Illustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors They don’t know where you want to go, they just follow your commands. (And if you get the directions wrong, you end up in the wrong place!) It’s called imperative because you have to “command” each element, from the spinner to the button, telling the computer how to update the UI. In this example of imperative UI programming, the form is built without React. It only uses the browser DOM : index.js index.html index.js Reset Fork async function handleFormSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); disable(textarea); disable(button); show(loadingMessage); hide(errorMessage); try { await submitForm(textarea.value); show(successMessage); hide(form); } catch (err) { show(errorMessage); errorMessage.textContent = err.message; } finally { hide(loadingMessage); enable(textarea); enable(button); } } function handleTextareaChange() { if (textarea.value.length === 0) { disable(button); } else { enable(button); } } function hide(el) { el.style.display = 'none'; } function show(el) { el.style.display = ''; } function enable(el) { el.disabled = false; } function disable(el)\"),\n",

Try again!')); } }, 1500); }); } let form = document.getElementById('form'); let textarea = document.getElementById('textarea'); let button = document.getElementById('button'); let loadingMessage = document.getElementById('loading'); let errorMessage = document.getElementById('error'); let successMessage = document.getElementById('success'); form.onsubmit = handleFormSubmit; textarea.oninput = handleTextareaChange; Show more Manipulating the UI imperatively works well enough for isolated examples, but it gets exponentially more difficult to manage in more complex systems. Imagine updating a page full of different forms like this one. Adding a new UI element or a new interaction would require carefully checking all existing code to make sure you haven’t introduced a bug (for example, forgetting to show or hide something). React was built to solve this problem. In React, you don’t directly manipulate the UI—meaning you don’t enable, disable, show, or hide components directly. Instead, you declare what you want to show, and React figures out how to update the UI. Think of getting into a taxi and telling the driver where you want to go instead of telling them exactly where to turn. It’s the driver’s job to get you there, and they might even know some shortcuts you haven’t considered!

To better understand how to think in React, you’ll walk through reimplementing this UI in React below: Identify your component’s different visual states Determine what triggers those state changes Represent the state in memory using useState Remove any non-essential state variables Connect the event handlers to set the state Step 1: Identify your component’s different visual states In computer science, you may hear about a “state machine” being in one of several “states”. If you work with a designer, you may have seen mockups for different “visual states”. React stands at the intersection of design and computer science, so both of these ideas are sources of inspiration. First, you need to visualize all the different “states” of the UI the user might see: Empty : Form has a disabled “Submit” button. Typing : Form has an enabled “Submit” button. Submitting : Form is completely disabled. Spinner is shown. Success : “Thank you” message is shown instead of a form. Error : Same as Typing state, but with an extra error message. Just like a designer, you’ll want to “mock up” or create “mocks” for the different states before you add logic. For example, here is a mock for just the visual part of the form. This mock is controlled by a prop called status with a default value of 'empty' : App.js App.js Reset Fork export default function Form({ status = 'empty' }) { if (status === 'success') { return <h1>That's right!</h1> } return ( <> <h2>City quiz</h2> <p> In which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water? </p> <form> <textarea /> <br /> <button> Submit </button> </form> </> ) } Show more You could call that prop anything you like, the naming is not important.

Try again! </p> } </form> </> ); } Show more Deep Dive Displaying many visual states at once Show Details If a component has a lot of visual states, it can be convenient to show them all on one page: App.js Form.js App.js Reset Fork import Form from \\'./Form.js\\'; let statuses = [ \\'empty\\', \\'typing\\', \\'submitting\\', \\'success\\', \\'error\\', ]; export default function App() { return ( <> {statuses.map(status => ( <section key={status}> <h4>Form ({status}):</h4> <Form status={status} /> </section> ))} </> ); } Show more Pages like this are often called “living styleguides” or “storybooks”. Step 2: Determine what triggers those state changes You can trigger state updates in response to two kinds of inputs: Human inputs, like clicking a button, typing in a field, navigating a link. Computer inputs, like a network response arriving, a timeout completing, an image loading. Human inputs Computer inputs Illustrated by Rachel Lee Nabors In both cases, you must set state variables to update the UI. For the form you’re developing, you will need to change state in response to a few different inputs: Changing the text input (human) should switch it from the Empty state to the Typing state or back, depending on whether the text box is empty or not.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"state in response to a few different inputs: Changing the text input (human) should switch it from the Empty state to the Typing state or back, depending on whether the text box is empty or not. Clicking the Submit button (human) should switch it to the Submitting state. Successful network response (computer) should switch it to the Success state. Failed network response (computer) should switch it to the Error state with the matching error message. Note Notice that human inputs often require event handlers ! To help visualize this flow, try drawing each state on paper as a labeled circle, and each change between two states as an arrow. You can sketch out many flows this way and sort out bugs long before implementation. Form states Step 3: Represent the state in memory with useState Next you’ll need to represent the visual states of your component in memory with useState . Simplicity is key: each piece of state is a “moving piece”, and you want as few “moving pieces” as possible. More complexity leads to more bugs! Start with the state that absolutely must be there. For example, you’ll need to store the answer for the input, and the error (if it exists) to store the last error: <code_snipet> const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');const [error, setError] = useState(null); </code_snipet> Then, you’ll need a state variable representing which one of the visual states that you want to display. There’s usually more than a single way to represent that in memory, so you’ll need to experiment with it. If you struggle to think of the best way immediately, start by adding enough state that you’re definitely sure that all the possible visual states are covered: <code_snipet> const [isEmpty, setIsEmpty] = useState(true);const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false);const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false); </code_snipet> Your first idea likely won’t be the best,\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false); </code_snipet> Your first idea likely won’t be the best, but that’s ok—refactoring state is a part of the process! Step 4: Remove any non-essential state variables You want to avoid duplication in the state content so you’re only tracking what is essential. Spending a little time on refactoring your state structure will make your components easier to understand, reduce duplication, and avoid unintended meanings. Your goal is to prevent the cases where the state in memory doesn’t represent any valid UI that you’d want a user to see. (For example, you never want to show an error message and disable the input at the same time, or the user won’t be able to correct the error!) Here are some questions you can ask about your state variables: Does this state cause a paradox? For example, isTyping and isSubmitting can’t both be true . A paradox usually means that the state is not constrained enough. There are four possible combinations of two booleans, but only three correspond to valid states. To remove the “impossible” state, you can combine these into a status that must be one of three values: 'typing' , 'submitting' , or 'success' . Is the same information available in another state variable already? Another paradox: isEmpty and isTyping can’t be true at the same time. By making them separate state variables, you risk them going out of sync and causing bugs. Fortunately, you can remove isEmpty and instead check answer.length === 0 . Can you get the same information from the inverse of another state variable? isError is not needed because you can check error !== null instead. After this clean-up, you’re left with 3 (down from 7!) essential state variables: <code_snipet> const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');const [error, setError] = useState(null);const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing'); // 'typing', 'submitting', or 'success'\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='variables: <code_snipet> const [answer, setAnswer] = useState(\\'\\');const [error, setError] = useState(null);const [status, setStatus] = useState(\\'typing\\'); // \\'typing\\', \\'submitting\\', or \\'success\\' </code_snipet> You know they are essential, because you can’t remove any of them without breaking the functionality. Deep Dive Eliminating “impossible” states with a reducer Show Details These three variables are a good enough representation of this form’s state. However, there are still some intermediate states that don’t fully make sense. For example, a non-null error doesn’t make sense when status is \\'success\\' . To model the state more precisely, you can extract it into a reducer. Reducers let you unify multiple state variables into a single object and consolidate all the related logic!

Expressing all interactions as state changes lets you later introduce new visual states without breaking existing ones. It also lets you change what should be displayed in each state without changing the logic of the interaction itself. Recap Declarative programming means describing the UI for each visual state rather than micromanaging the UI (imperative). When developing a component: Identify all its visual states. Determine the human and computer triggers for state changes. Model the state with useState . Remove non-essential state to avoid bugs and paradoxes. Connect the event handlers to set state.

Here are some tips you should consider when structuring state. You will learn When to use a single vs multiple state variables What to avoid when organizing state How to fix common issues with the state structure Principles for structuring state When you write a component that holds some state, you’ll have to make choices about how many state variables to use and what the shape of their data should be.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='many state variables to use and what the shape of their data should be. While it’s possible to write correct programs even with a suboptimal state structure, there are a few principles that can guide you to make better choices: Group related state. If you always update two or more state variables at the same time, consider merging them into a single state variable. Avoid contradictions in state. When the state is structured in a way that several pieces of state may contradict and “disagree” with each other, you leave room for mistakes. Try to avoid this. Avoid redundant state. If you can calculate some information from the component’s props or its existing state variables during rendering, you should not put that information into that component’s state. Avoid duplication in state. When the same data is duplicated between multiple state variables, or within nested objects, it is difficult to keep them in sync. Reduce duplication when you can. Avoid deeply nested state. Deeply hierarchical state is not very convenient to update. When possible, prefer to structure state in a flat way. The goal behind these principles is to make state easy to update without introducing mistakes . Removing redundant and duplicate data from state helps ensure that all its pieces stay in sync. This is similar to how a database engineer might want to “normalize” the database structure to reduce the chance of bugs. To paraphrase Albert Einstein, “Make your state as simple as it can be—but no simpler.” Now let’s see how these principles apply in action. Group related state You might sometimes be unsure between using a single or multiple state variables. Should you do this? <code_snipet> const [x, setX] = useState(0);const [y, setY] = useState(0); </code_snipet> Or this? <code_snipet> const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 }); </code_snipet> Technically, you can use either of these approaches. But if some two state variables always change together, it might be a good idea to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 }); </code_snipet> Technically, you can use either of these approaches. But if some two state variables always change together, it might be a good idea to unify them into a single state variable. Then you won’t forget to always keep them in sync, like in this example where moving the cursor updates both coordinates of the red dot: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function MovingDot() { const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 }); return ( <div onPointerMove={e => { setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY }); }} style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100vw', height: '100vh', }}> <div style={{ position: 'absolute', backgroundColor: 'red', borderRadius: '50%', transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`, left: -10, top: -10, width: 20, height: 20, }} /> </div> ) } Show more Another case where you’ll group data into an object or an array is when you don’t know how many pieces of state you’ll need. For example, it’s helpful when you have a form where the user can add custom fields. Pitfall If your state variable is an object, remember that you can’t update only one field in it without explicitly copying the other fields. For example, you can’t do setPosition({ x: 100 }) in the above example because it would not have the y property at all! Instead, if you wanted to set x alone, you would either do setPosition({ ...position, x: 100 }) , or split them into two state variables and do setX(100) . Avoid contradictions in state Here is a hotel feedback form with isSending and isSent state variables: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function FeedbackForm() { const [text, setText] = useState(''); const [isSending, setIsSending] = useState(false); const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false); async function handleSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); setIsSending(true); await sendMessage(text); setIsSending(false); setIsSent(true); } if\"),\n",

For example, if you forget to call setIsSent and setIsSending together, you may end up in a situation where both isSending and isSent are true at the same time. The more complex your component is, the harder it is to understand what happened. Since isSending and isSent should never be true at the same time, it is better to replace them with one status state variable that may take one of three valid states: \\'typing\\' (initial), \\'sending\\' , and \\'sent\\' : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function FeedbackForm() { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); const [status, setStatus] = useState(\\'typing\\'); async function handleSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); setStatus(\\'sending\\'); await sendMessage(text); setStatus(\\'sent\\'); } const isSending = status === \\'sending\\'; const isSent = status === \\'sent\\'; if (isSent) { return <h1>Thanks for feedback!</h1> } return ( <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> <p>How was your stay at The Prancing Pony?</p> <textarea disabled={isSending} value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> <br /> <button disabled={isSending} type=\"submit\" > Send </button> {isSending && <p>Sending...</p>} </form> ); } // Pretend to send a message. function sendMessage(text) { return new Promise(resolve => {'),\n",

Avoid redundant state If you can calculate some information from the component’s props or its existing state variables during rendering, you should not put that information into that component’s state. For example, take this form. It works, but can you find any redundant state in it? App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(\\'\\'); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(\\'\\'); const [fullName, setFullName] = useState(\\'\\'); function handleFirstNameChange(e) { setFirstName(e.target.value); setFullName(e.target.value + \\' \\' + lastName); } function handleLastNameChange(e) { setLastName(e.target.value); setFullName(firstName + \\' \\' + e.target.value); } return ( <> <h2>Let’s check you in</h2> <label> First name:{\\' \\'} <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} /> </label> <label> Last name:{\\' \\'} <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} /> </label> <p> Your ticket will be issued to: <b>{fullName}</b> </p> </> ); } Show more This form has three state variables: firstName , lastName , and fullName . However, fullName is redundant. You can always calculate fullName from firstName and lastName during render, so remove it from state. This is how you can do it: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(\\'\\'); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(\\'\\'); const fullName ='),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(''); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(''); const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName; function handleFirstNameChange(e) { setFirstName(e.target.value); } function handleLastNameChange(e) { setLastName(e.target.value); } return ( <> <h2>Let’s check you in</h2> <label> First name:{' '} <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} /> </label> <label> Last name:{' '} <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} /> </label> <p> Your ticket will be issued to: <b>{fullName}</b> </p> </> ); } Show more Here, fullName is not a state variable. Instead, it’s calculated during render: <code_snipet> const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName; </code_snipet> As a result, the change handlers don’t need to do anything special to update it. When you call setFirstName or setLastName , you trigger a re-render, and then the next fullName will be calculated from the fresh data. Deep Dive Don’t mirror props in state Show Details A common example of redundant state is code like this: <code_snipet> function Message({ messageColor }) { const [color, setColor] = useState(messageColor); </code_snipet> Here, a color state variable is initialized to the messageColor prop. The problem is that if the parent component passes a different value of messageColor later (for example, 'red' instead of 'blue' ), the color state variable would not be updated! The state is only initialized during the first render. This is why “mirroring” some prop in a state variable can lead to confusion. Instead, use the messageColor prop directly in your code. If you want to give it a shorter name, use a constant: <code_snipet> function Message({ messageColor }) { const color = messageColor; </code_snipet> This way it won’t get out of sync with the prop passed from the parent component. ”Mirroring” props into state only makes sense when you want to ignore all\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"const color = messageColor; </code_snipet> This way it won’t get out of sync with the prop passed from the parent component. ”Mirroring” props into state only makes sense when you want to ignore all updates for a specific prop. By convention, start the prop name with initial or default to clarify that its new values are ignored: <code_snipet> function Message({ initialColor }) { // The `color` state variable holds the *first* value of `initialColor`. // Further changes to the `initialColor` prop are ignored. const [color, setColor] = useState(initialColor); </code_snipet> Avoid duplication in state This menu list component lets you choose a single travel snack out of several: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; const initialItems = [ { title: 'pretzels', id: 0 }, { title: 'crispy seaweed', id: 1 }, { title: 'granola bar', id: 2 }, ]; export default function Menu() { const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems); const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = useState( items[0] ); return ( <> <h2>What's your travel snack?</h2> <ul> {items.map(item => ( <li key={item.id}> {item.title} {' '} <button onClick={() => { setSelectedItem(item); }}>Choose</button> </li> ))} </ul> <p>You picked {selectedItem.title}.</p> </> ); } Show more Currently, it stores the selected item as an object in the selectedItem state variable. However, this is not great: the contents of the selectedItem is the same object as one of the items inside the items list. This means that the information about the item itself is duplicated in two places. Why is this a problem? Let’s make each item editable: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; const initialItems = [ { title: 'pretzels', id: 0 }, { title: 'crispy seaweed', id: 1 }, { title: 'granola bar', id: 2 }, ]; export default function Menu() { const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems); const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = useState( items[0] ); function handleItemChange(id, e) {\"),\n",

This is because you have duplicated state, and you forgot to update selectedItem . Although you could update selectedItem too, an easier fix is to remove duplication. In this example, instead of a selectedItem object (which creates a duplication with objects inside items ), you hold the selectedId in state, and then get the selectedItem by searching the items array for an item with that ID: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; const initialItems = [ { title: 'pretzels', id: 0 }, { title: 'crispy seaweed', id: 1 }, { title: 'granola bar', id: 2 }, ]; export default function Menu() { const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems); const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(0); const selectedItem = items.find(item => item.id === selectedId ); function handleItemChange(id, e) { setItems(items.map(item => { if (item.id === id) { return { ...item, title: e.target.value, }; } else { return item; } })); } return ( <> <h2>What's your travel snack?</h2> <ul> {items.map((item, index) => ( <li key={item.id}> <input value={item.title} onChange={e => { handleItemChange(item.id, e) }} /> {' '} <button onClick={() => { setSelectedId(item.id); }}>Choose</button> </li> ))} </ul>\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"index) => ( <li key={item.id}> <input value={item.title} onChange={e => { handleItemChange(item.id, e) }} /> {' '} <button onClick={() => { setSelectedId(item.id); }}>Choose</button> </li> ))} </ul> <p>You picked {selectedItem.title}.</p> </> ); } Show more The state used to be duplicated like this: items = [{ id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}, ...] selectedItem = {id: 0, title: 'pretzels'} But after the change it’s like this: items = [{ id: 0, title: 'pretzels'}, ...] selectedId = 0 The duplication is gone, and you only keep the essential state! Now if you edit the selected item, the message below will update immediately. This is because setItems triggers a re-render, and items.find(...) would find the item with the updated title. You didn’t need to hold the selected item in state, because only the selected ID is essential. The rest could be calculated during render. Avoid deeply nested state Imagine a travel plan consisting of planets, continents, and countries. You might be tempted to structure its state using nested objects and arrays, like in this example: App.js places.js places.js Reset Fork export const initialTravelPlan = { id: 0, title: '(Root)', childPlaces: [{ id: 1, title: 'Earth', childPlaces: [{ id: 2, title: 'Africa', childPlaces: [{ id: 3, title: 'Botswana', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 4, title: 'Egypt', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 5, title: 'Kenya', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 6, title: 'Madagascar', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 7, title: 'Morocco', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 8, title: 'Nigeria', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 9, title: 'South Africa', childPlaces: [] }] }, { id: 10, title: 'Americas', childPlaces: [{ id: 11, title: 'Argentina', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 12, title: 'Brazil', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 13, title: 'Barbados', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 14, title: 'Canada', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 15, title: 'Jamaica', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 16, title: 'Mexico', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 17, title: 'Trinidad and Tobago', childPlaces: [] }, { id: 18, title:\"),\n",

This works well for ephemeral UI state that doesn’t need to be stored, like whether an item is hovered. Recap If two state variables always update together, consider merging them into one. Choose your state variables carefully to avoid creating “impossible” states. Structure your state in a way that reduces the chances that you’ll make a mistake updating it. Avoid redundant and duplicate state so that you don’t need to keep it in sync. Don’t put props into state unless you specifically want to prevent updates.

Learn React Managing State Sharing State Between Components Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as lifting state up, and it’s one of the most common things you will do writing React code. You will learn How to share state between components by lifting it up What are controlled and uncontrolled components Lifting state up by example In this example, a parent Accordion component renders two separate Panel s: Accordion Panel Panel Each Panel component has a boolean isActive state that determines whether its content is visible.

Initially, each Panel ’s isActive state is false , so they both appear collapsed Clicking either Panel ’s button will only update that Panel ’s isActive state alone But now let’s say you want to change it so that only one panel is expanded at any given time. With that design, expanding the second panel should collapse the first one. How would you do that? To coordinate these two panels, you need to “lift their state up” to a parent component in three steps: Remove state from the child components. Pass hardcoded data from the common parent. Add state to the common parent and pass it down together with the event handlers. This will allow the Accordion component to coordinate both Panel s and only expand one at a time. Step 1: Remove state from the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='to the common parent and pass it down together with the event handlers. This will allow the Accordion component to coordinate both Panel s and only expand one at a time. Step 1: Remove state from the child components You will give control of the Panel ’s isActive to its parent component. This means that the parent component will pass isActive to Panel as a prop instead. Start by removing this line from the Panel component: <code_snipet> const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false); </code_snipet> And instead, add isActive to the Panel ’s list of props: <code_snipet> function Panel({ title, children, isActive }) { </code_snipet> Now the Panel ’s parent component can control isActive by passing it down as a prop. Conversely, the Panel component now has no control over the value of isActive —it’s now up to the parent component! Step 2: Pass hardcoded data from the common parent To lift state up, you must locate the closest common parent component of both of the child components that you want to coordinate: Accordion (closest common parent) Panel Panel In this example, it’s the Accordion component. Since it’s above both panels and can control their props, it will become the “source of truth” for which panel is currently active. Make the Accordion component pass a hardcoded value of isActive (for example, true ) to both panels: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function Accordion() { return ( <> <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2> <Panel title=\"About\" isActive={true}> With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan\\'s largest city.

( <p>{children}</p> ) : ( <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}> Show </button> )} </section> ); } Show more Try editing the hardcoded isActive values in the Accordion component and see the result on the screen. Step 3: Add state to the common parent Lifting state up often changes the nature of what you’re storing as state. In this case, only one panel should be active at a time. This means that the Accordion common parent component needs to keep track of which panel is the active one. Instead of a boolean value, it could use a number as the index of the active Panel for the state variable: <code_snipet> const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0); </code_snipet> When the activeIndex is 0 , the first panel is active, and when it’s 1 , it’s the second one. Clicking the “Show” button in either Panel needs to change the active index in Accordion . A Panel can’t set the activeIndex state directly because it’s defined inside the Accordion . The Accordion component needs to explicitly allow the Panel component to change its state by passing an event handler down as a prop : <code_snipet> <> <Panel isActive={activeIndex === 0} onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)} > ... </Panel> <Panel isActive={activeIndex === 1} onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)} > ... </Panel></> </code_snipet> The <button> inside the Panel will now use the onShow prop as its click event handler: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function Accordion() { const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0); return ( <> <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2> <Panel title=\"About\" isActive={activeIndex === 0}'),\n",

( <p>{children}</p> ) : ( <button onClick={onShow}> Show </button> )} </section> ); } Show more This completes lifting state up! Moving state into the common parent component allowed you to coordinate the two panels. Using the active index instead of two “is shown” flags ensured that only one panel is active at a given time. And passing down the event handler to the child allowed the child to change the parent’s state. Initially, Accordion ’s activeIndex is 0 , so the first Panel receives isActive = true When Accordion ’s activeIndex state changes to 1 , the second Panel receives isActive = true instead Deep Dive Controlled and uncontrolled components Show Details It is common to call a component with some local state “uncontrolled”. For example, the original Panel component with an isActive state variable is uncontrolled because its parent cannot influence whether the panel is active or not. In contrast, you might say a component is “controlled” when the important information in it is driven by props rather than its own local state. This lets the parent'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='the panel is active or not. In contrast, you might say a component is “controlled” when the important information in it is driven by props rather than its own local state. This lets the parent component fully specify its behavior. The final Panel component with the isActive prop is controlled by the Accordion component. Uncontrolled components are easier to use within their parents because they require less configuration. But they’re less flexible when you want to coordinate them together. Controlled components are maximally flexible, but they require the parent components to fully configure them with props. In practice, “controlled” and “uncontrolled” aren’t strict technical terms—each component usually has some mix of both local state and props. However, this is a useful way to talk about how components are designed and what capabilities they offer. When writing a component, consider which information in it should be controlled (via props), and which information should be uncontrolled (via state). But you can always change your mind and refactor later. A single source of truth for each state In a React application, many components will have their own state. Some state may “live” close to the leaf components (components at the bottom of the tree) like inputs. Other state may “live” closer to the top of the app. For example, even client-side routing libraries are usually implemented by storing the current route in the React state, and passing it down by props! For each unique piece of state, you will choose the component that “owns” it. This principle is also known as having a “single source of truth”. It doesn’t mean that all state lives in one place—but that for each piece of state, there is a specific component that holds that piece of information. Instead of duplicating shared state between components, lift it up to their common shared parent, and pass it down to the children that need it. Your app will change as you work on it.

Your app will change as you work on it. It is common that you will move state down or back up while you’re still figuring out where each piece of the state “lives”. This is all part of the process! To see what this feels like in practice with a few more components, read Thinking in React. Recap When you want to coordinate two components, move their state to their common parent. Then pass the information down through props from their common parent. Finally, pass the event handlers down so that the children can change the parent’s state. It’s useful to consider components as “controlled” (driven by props) or “uncontrolled” (driven by state). Try out some challenges 1 . Synced inputs 2 .

But the state is actually held inside React. React associates each piece of state it’s holding with the correct component by where that component sits in the render tree. Here, there is only one <Counter /> JSX tag, but it’s rendered at two different positions: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function App() { const counter = <Counter />; return ( <div> {counter} {counter} </div> ); } function Counter() { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false); let className = 'counter'; if (hover) { className += ' hover'; } return ( <div className={className} onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} > <h1>{score}</h1> <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}> Add one </button> </div> ); } Show more Here’s how these look as a tree: React tree These are two separate counters because each is rendered at its own position in the tree. You don’t usually have to think about these positions to use React, but it can be useful to understand how it works. In React, each component on the screen has fully isolated state. For example, if you render two Counter components side by side, each of them will get its own, independent, score and hover states. Try clicking both counters and notice they don’t affect each other: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function App() { return ( <div> <Counter /> <Counter /> </div> ); } function Counter() { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false); let className = 'counter'; if (hover) { className += ' hover'; } return ( <div className={className} onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} > <h1>{score}</h1> <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}> Add one </button> </div> ); } Show more As you can see, when one\"),\n",

To see this, increment both counters, then remove the second component by unchecking “Render the second counter” checkbox, and then add it back by ticking it again: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function App() { const [showB, setShowB] = useState(true); return ( <div> <Counter /> {showB && <Counter />} <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={showB} onChange={e => { setShowB(e.target.checked) }} /> Render the second counter </label> </div> ); } function Counter() { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false); let className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; } return ( <div className={className} onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)} onPointerLeave={() => setHover(false)} > <h1>{score}</h1> <button onClick={() => setScore(score + 1)}> Add one </button> </div> ); } Show more Notice how the moment you stop rendering the second counter, its state disappears completely. That’s because when React removes a component, it destroys its state. Deleting a component When you tick “Render the second counter”, a second Counter and its state are initialized from scratch ( score = 0 ) and added to the DOM. Adding a component React preserves a component’s state for as long as it’s being rendered at its position in the UI tree. If it gets removed, or a different component gets rendered at the same position, React discards its state. Same component at the same position preserves state In this example, there are two different <Counter /> tags: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default'),\n",

Pitfall Remember that it’s the position in the UI tree—not in the JSX markup—that matters to React!

This is because both of these <Counter /> tags are rendered at the same position. React doesn’t know where you place the conditions in your function. All it “sees” is the tree you return. In both cases, the App component returns a <div> with <Counter /> as a first child. To React, these two counters have the same “address”: the first child of the first child of the root. This is how React matches them up between the previous and next renders, regardless of how you structure your logic. Different components at the same position reset state In this example, ticking the checkbox will replace <Counter> with a <p> : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function App() { const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false); return ( <div> {isPaused ? ( <p>See you later!</p> ) : ( <Counter /> )} <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={isPaused} onChange={e => { setIsPaused(e.target.checked) }} /> Take a break </label> </div> ); } function Counter() { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] = useState(false); let className = \\'counter\\'; if (hover) { className += \\' hover\\'; } return ( <div className={className} onPointerEnter={() => setHover(true)}'),\n",

Initially, the first child of the <div> contained a Counter . But when you swapped in a p , React removed the Counter from the UI tree and destroyed its state. When Counter changes to p , the Counter is deleted and the p is added When switching back, the p is deleted and the Counter is added Also, when you render a different component in the same position, it resets the state of its entire subtree. To see how this works, increment the counter and then tick the checkbox: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function App() { const [isFancy, setIsFancy] = useState(false); return ( <div> {isFancy ?

When section changes to div , the section is deleted and the new div is added When switching back, the div is deleted and the new section is added As a rule of thumb, if you want to preserve the state between re-renders, the structure of your tree needs to “match up” from one render to another. If the structure is different, the state gets destroyed because React destroys state when it removes a component from the tree. Pitfall This is why you should not nest component function definitions. Here, the MyTextField component function is defined inside MyComponent : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function MyComponent() { const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0); function MyTextField() { const [text, setText] = useState(''); return ( <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> ); } return ( <> <MyTextField /> <button onClick={() => { setCounter(counter + 1) }}>Clicked {counter} times</button> </> ); } Show more Every time you click the button, the input state disappears! This is because a different MyTextField function is created for every render of MyComponent . You’re rendering a different component in the same position, so React resets all state below. This leads to bugs and performance problems. To avoid this problem, always declare component functions at the top level, and don’t nest their definitions. Resetting state at the same position By default, React preserves state of a component while it stays at the same position. Usually, this is exactly what you want, so it makes sense as the default behavior. But sometimes, you may want to reset a component’s state. Consider this app that lets two players keep track of their scores during each turn: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react';\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='sometimes, you may want to reset a component’s state.

The two Counter s appear in the same position, so React sees them as the same Counter whose person prop has changed. But conceptually, in this app they should be two separate counters. They might appear in the same place in the UI, but one is a counter for Taylor, and another is a counter for Sarah. There are two ways to reset state when switching between them: Render components in different positions Give each component an explicit identity with key Option 1: Rendering a component in different positions If you want these two Counter s to be independent, you can render them in two different positions: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function Scoreboard() { const [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true); return ( <div> {isPlayerA && <Counter person=\"Taylor\" /> } {!isPlayerA && <Counter person=\"Sarah\" /> } <button onClick={() => { setIsPlayerA(!isPlayerA); }}> Next player! </button> </div> ); } function Counter({ person }) { const [score, setScore] = useState(0); const [hover, setHover] ='),\n",

So the first position contains Counter state, and the second one is empty. When you click the “Next player” button the first position clears but the second one now contains a Counter . Initial state Clicking “next” Clicking “next” again Each Counter ’s state gets destroyed each time it’s removed from the DOM. This is why they reset every time you click the button. This solution is convenient when you only have a few independent components rendered in the same place. In this example, you only have two, so it’s not a hassle to render both separately in the JSX. Option 2: Resetting state with a key There is also another, more generic, way to reset a component’s state. You might have seen key s when rendering lists. Keys aren’t just for lists! You can use keys to make React distinguish between any components. By default, React uses order within the parent (“first counter”, “second counter”) to discern between components. But keys let you tell React that this is not just a first counter, or a second counter, but a specific counter—for example, Taylor’s counter. This way, React will know Taylor’s counter wherever it appears in the tree! In this example, the two <Counter /> s don’t share state even though they appear in the same place in JSX: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; export default function Scoreboard() { const [isPlayerA, setIsPlayerA] = useState(true); return ( <div> {isPlayerA ? ( <Counter key=\"Taylor\"'),\n",

This is because you gave them different key s: <code_snipet> {isPlayerA ? ( <Counter key=\"Taylor\" person=\"Taylor\" />) : ( <Counter key=\"Sarah\" person=\"Sarah\" />)} </code_snipet> Specifying a key tells React to use the key itself as part of the position, instead of their order within the parent. This is why, even though you render them in the same place in JSX, React sees them as two different counters, and so they will never share state. Every time a counter appears on the screen, its state is created. Every time it is removed, its state is destroyed. Toggling between them resets their state over and over. Note Remember that keys are not globally unique. They only specify the position within the parent . Resetting a form with a key Resetting state with a key is particularly useful when dealing with forms. In this chat app, the <Chat> component contains the text input state: App.js ContactList.js Chat.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from \\'react\\'; import Chat from \\'./Chat.js\\'; import ContactList from \\'./ContactList.js\\'; export default function Messenger() { const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]); return ( <div> <ContactList'),\n",

You will notice that the input state is preserved because the <Chat> is rendered at the same position in the tree. In many apps, this may be the desired behavior, but not in a chat app! You don’t want to let the user send a message they already typed to a wrong person due to an accidental click. To fix it, add a key : <code_snipet> <Chat key={to.id} contact={to} /> </code_snipet> This ensures that when you select a different recipient, the Chat component will be recreated from scratch, including any state in the tree below it. React will also re-create the DOM elements instead of reusing them. Now switching the recipient always clears the text field: App.js ContactList.js Chat.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; import Chat from './Chat.js'; import ContactList from './ContactList.js'; export default function Messenger() { const [to, setTo] = useState(contacts[0]); return ( <div> <ContactList contacts={contacts} selectedContact={to} onSelect={contact => setTo(contact)} /> <Chat key={to.id} contact={to} /> </div> ) } const contacts = [ { id: 0, name: 'Taylor', email:  }, { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email:  }, { id: 2, name: 'Bob', email:  } ]; Show more Deep Dive Preserving state for removed components Show Details In a real chat app, you’d probably want to recover the input state when the user selects the previous recipient again.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='In a real chat app, you’d probably want to recover the input state when the user selects the previous recipient again. There are a few ways to keep the state “alive” for a component that’s no longer visible: You could render all chats instead of just the current one, but hide all the others with CSS. The chats would not get removed from the tree, so their local state would be preserved. This solution works great for simple UIs. But it can get very slow if the hidden trees are large and contain a lot of DOM nodes. You could lift the state up and hold the pending message for each recipient in the parent component. This way, when the child components get removed, it doesn’t matter, because it’s the parent that keeps the important information. This is the most common solution. You might also use a different source in addition to React state. For example, you probably want a message draft to persist even if the user accidentally closes the page. To implement this, you could have the Chat component initialize its state by reading from the localStorage , and save the drafts there too. No matter which strategy you pick, a chat with Alice is conceptually distinct from a chat with Bob , so it makes sense to give a key to the <Chat> tree based on the current recipient. Recap React keeps state for as long as the same component is rendered at the same position. State is not kept in JSX tags. It’s associated with the tree position in which you put that JSX. You can force a subtree to reset its state by giving it a different key. Don’t nest component definitions, or you’ll reset state by accident. Try out some challenges 1 .

For example, the TaskApp component below holds an array of tasks in state and uses three different event handlers to add, remove, and edit tasks: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; import AddTask from './AddTask.js'; import TaskList from './TaskList.js'; export default function TaskApp() { const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks); function handleAddTask(text) { setTasks([ ...tasks, { id: nextId++, text: text, done: false, }, ]); } function handleChangeTask(task) { setTasks( tasks.map((t) => { if (t.id === task.id) { return task; } else { return t; } }) ); } function handleDeleteTask(taskId) { setTasks(tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== taskId)); } return ( <> <h1>Prague itinerary</h1> <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} /> <TaskList tasks={tasks} onChangeTask={handleChangeTask} onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask} /> </> ); } let nextId = 3; const initialTasks = [ {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true}, {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false}, {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false}, ]; Show more Each of its event handlers calls setTasks in order to update the state. As this component grows, so does the amount of state logic sprinkled throughout it. To reduce this complexity and keep all your logic in one easy-to-access place, you can move that state logic into a single function outside your component, called a “reducer”. Reducers are a different way to handle state. You can migrate from useState to useReducer in three steps: Move from setting state to dispatching actions. Write a reducer function. Use the reducer from your component. Step 1: Move from setting state to dispatching actions Your event handlers currently specify what to do by setting state: <code_snipet> function handleAddTask(text) { setTasks([ ...tasks, { id: nextId++, text: text, done: false, }, ]);}function handleChangeTask(task) { setTasks( tasks.map((t) => { if (t.id === task.id) {\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='function handleAddTask(text) { setTasks([ ...tasks, { id: nextId++, text: text, done: false, }, ]);}function handleChangeTask(task) { setTasks( tasks.map((t) => { if (t.id === task.id) { return task; } else { return t; } }) );}function handleDeleteTask(taskId) { setTasks(tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== taskId));} </code_snipet> Remove all the state setting logic. What you are left with are three event handlers: handleAddTask(text) is called when the user presses “Add”. handleChangeTask(task) is called when the user toggles a task or presses “Save”. handleDeleteTask(taskId) is called when the user presses “Delete”. Managing state with reducers is slightly different from directly setting state. Instead of telling React “what to do” by setting state, you specify “what the user just did” by dispatching “actions” from your event handlers. (The state update logic will live elsewhere!) So instead of “setting tasks ” via an event handler, you’re dispatching an “added/changed/deleted a task” action. This is more descriptive of the user’s intent. <code_snipet> function handleAddTask(text) { dispatch({ type: \\'added\\', id: nextId++, text: text, });}function handleChangeTask(task) { dispatch({ type: \\'changed\\', task: task, });}function handleDeleteTask(taskId) { dispatch({ type: \\'deleted\\', id: taskId, });} </code_snipet> The object you pass to dispatch is called an “action”: <code_snipet> function handleDeleteTask(taskId) { dispatch( // \"action\" object: { type: \\'deleted\\', id: taskId, } );} </code_snipet> It is a regular JavaScript object. You decide what to put in it, but generally it should contain the minimal information about what happened . (You will add the dispatch function itself in a later step.) Note An action object can have any shape. By convention, it is common to give it a string type that describes what happened, and pass any additional information in other fields. The type is specific to a component, so in this example either \\'added\\' or \\'added_task\\' would be fine.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"a string type that describes what happened, and pass any additional information in other fields. The type is specific to a component, so in this example either 'added' or 'added_task' would be fine. Choose a name that says what happened! <code_snipet> dispatch({ // specific to component type: 'what_happened', // other fields go here}); </code_snipet> Step 2: Write a reducer function A reducer function is where you will put your state logic. It takes two arguments, the current state and the action object, and it returns the next state: <code_snipet> function yourReducer(state, action) { // return next state for React to set} </code_snipet> React will set the state to what you return from the reducer. To move your state setting logic from your event handlers to a reducer function in this example, you will: Declare the current state ( tasks ) as the first argument. Declare the action object as the second argument. Return the next state from the reducer (which React will set the state to). Here is all the state setting logic migrated to a reducer function: <code_snipet> function tasksReducer(tasks, action) { if (action.type === 'added') { return [ ...tasks, { id: action.id, text: action.text, done: false, }, ]; } else if (action.type === 'changed') { return tasks.map((t) => { if (t.id === action.task.id) { return action.task; } else { return t; } }); } else if (action.type === 'deleted') { return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id); } else { throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type); }} </code_snipet> Because the reducer function takes state ( tasks ) as an argument, you can declare it outside of your component. This decreases the indentation level and can make your code easier to read. Note The code above uses if/else statements, but it’s a convention to use switch statements inside reducers. The result is the same, but it can be easier to read switch statements at a glance. We’ll be using them throughout the rest of this documentation like so: <code_snipet>\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"statements inside reducers. The result is the same, but it can be easier to read switch statements at a glance. We’ll be using them throughout the rest of this documentation like so: <code_snipet> function tasksReducer(tasks, action) { switch (action.type) { case 'added': { return [ ...tasks, { id: action.id, text: action.text, done: false, }, ]; } case 'changed': { return tasks.map((t) => { if (t.id === action.task.id) { return action.task; } else { return t; } }); } case 'deleted': { return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id); } default: { throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type); } }} </code_snipet> We recommend wrapping each case block into the { and } curly braces so that variables declared inside of different case s don’t clash with each other. Also, a case should usually end with a return . If you forget to return , the code will “fall through” to the next case , which can lead to mistakes! If you’re not yet comfortable with switch statements, using if/else is completely fine. Deep Dive Why are reducers called this way? Show Details Although reducers can “reduce” the amount of code inside your component, they are actually named after the reduce() operation that you can perform on arrays. The reduce() operation lets you take an array and “accumulate” a single value out of many: <code_snipet> const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];const sum = arr.reduce( (result, number) => result + number); // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 </code_snipet> The function you pass to reduce is known as a “reducer”. It takes the result so far and the current item, then it returns the next result. React reducers are an example of the same idea: they take the state so far and the action , and return the next state. In this way, they accumulate actions over time into state. You could even use the reduce() method with an initialState and an array of actions to calculate the final state by passing your reducer function to it: index.js index.html tasksReducer.js index.js Reset Fork import tasksReducer\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"method with an initialState and an array of actions to calculate the final state by passing your reducer function to it: index.js index.html tasksReducer.js index.js Reset Fork import tasksReducer from './tasksReducer.js'; let initialState = []; let actions = [ {type: 'added', id: 1, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum'}, {type: 'added', id: 2, text: 'Watch a puppet show'}, {type: 'deleted', id: 1}, {type: 'added', id: 3, text: 'Lennon Wall pic'}, ]; let finalState = actions.reduce(tasksReducer, initialState); const output = document.getElementById('output'); output.textContent = JSON.stringify(finalState, null, 2); You probably won’t need to do this yourself, but this is similar to what React does! Step 3: Use the reducer from your component Finally, you need to hook up the tasksReducer to your component. Import the useReducer Hook from React: <code_snipet> import { useReducer } from 'react'; </code_snipet> Then you can replace useState : <code_snipet> const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks); </code_snipet> with useReducer like so: <code_snipet> const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks); </code_snipet> The useReducer Hook is similar to useState —you must pass it an initial state and it returns a stateful value and a way to set state (in this case, the dispatch function). But it’s a little different. The useReducer Hook takes two arguments: A reducer function An initial state And it returns: A stateful value A dispatch function (to “dispatch” user actions to the reducer) Now it’s fully wired up! Here, the reducer is declared at the bottom of the component file: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useReducer } from 'react'; import AddTask from './AddTask.js'; import TaskList from './TaskList.js'; export default function TaskApp() { const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks); function handleAddTask(text) { dispatch({ type: 'added', id: nextId++, text: text, }); } function handleChangeTask(task) { dispatch({ type: 'changed',\"),\n",

Now the event handlers only specify what happened by dispatching actions, and the reducer function determines how the state updates in response to them. Comparing useState and useReducer Reducers are not without downsides! Here’s a few ways you can compare them: Code size: Generally, with useState you have to write less code upfront. With useReducer , you have to write both a reducer function and dispatch actions. However, useReducer can help cut down on the code if many event handlers modify state in a similar way. Readability: useState is very easy to read when the state updates are simple. When they get more complex, they can bloat your component’s code and make it difficult to scan. In this case, useReducer lets you cleanly separate the how of update logic from the what happened of event handlers. Debugging: When you have a bug with useState , it can be difficult to tell where the state was set incorrectly, and why . With useReducer , you can add a console log into your reducer to see every state update, and why it happened (due to which action ). If each action is correct, you’ll know that the mistake is in the reducer logic itself. However, you have to step through more code than with useState . Testing: A reducer is a pure function that doesn’t depend on your component. This means that you can export and test it separately in isolation. While generally it’s best to test components in a more realistic environment, for complex state update logic it can be useful to assert that your reducer returns a particular state for a particular initial state and action.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='be useful to assert that your reducer returns a particular state for a particular initial state and action. Personal preference: Some people like reducers, others don’t. That’s okay. It’s a matter of preference. You can always convert between useState and useReducer back and forth: they are equivalent! We recommend using a reducer if you often encounter bugs due to incorrect state updates in some component, and want to introduce more structure to its code. You don’t have to use reducers for everything: feel free to mix and match! You can even useState and useReducer in the same component. Writing reducers well Keep these two tips in mind when writing reducers: Reducers must be pure. Similar to state updater functions , reducers run during rendering! (Actions are queued until the next render.) This means that reducers must be pure —same inputs always result in the same output. They should not send requests, schedule timeouts, or perform any side effects (operations that impact things outside the component). They should update objects and arrays without mutations. Each action describes a single user interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in the data. For example, if a user presses “Reset” on a form with five fields managed by a reducer, it makes more sense to dispatch one reset_form action rather than five separate set_field actions. If you log every action in a reducer, that log should be clear enough for you to reconstruct what interactions or responses happened in what order. This helps with debugging! Writing concise reducers with Immer Just like with updating objects and arrays in regular state, you can use the Immer library to make reducers more concise. Here, useImmerReducer lets you mutate the state with push or arr[i] = assignment: package.json App.js package.json Reset Fork { \"dependencies\": { \"immer\": \"1.7.3\", \"react\": \"latest\", \"react-dom\": \"latest\", \"react-scripts\": \"latest\", \"use-immer\": \"0.5.1\" }, \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"react-scripts'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='App.js package.json Reset Fork { \"dependencies\": { \"immer\": \"1.7.3\", \"react\": \"latest\", \"react-dom\": \"latest\", \"react-scripts\": \"latest\", \"use-immer\": \"0.5.1\" }, \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"react-scripts start\", \"build\": \"react-scripts build\", \"test\": \"react-scripts test --env=jsdom\", \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\" }, \"devDependencies\": {} } Reducers must be pure, so they shouldn’t mutate state. But Immer provides you with a special draft object which is safe to mutate. Under the hood, Immer will create a copy of your state with the changes you made to the draft . This is why reducers managed by useImmerReducer can mutate their first argument and don’t need to return state. Recap To convert from useState to useReducer : Dispatch actions from event handlers. Write a reducer function that returns the next state for a given state and action. Replace useState with useReducer . Reducers require you to write a bit more code, but they help with debugging and testing. Reducers must be pure. Each action describes a single user interaction. Use Immer if you want to write reducers in a mutating style. Try out some challenges 1 . Dispatch actions from event handlers 2 . Clear the input on sending a message 3 . Restore input values when switching between tabs 4 .

Learn React Managing State Passing Data Deeply with Context Usually, you will pass information from a parent component to a child component via props. But passing props can become verbose and inconvenient if you have to pass them through many components in the middle, or if many components in your app need the same information. Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it—no matter how deep—without passing it explicitly through props.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"is How to replace repetitive prop passing with context Common use cases for context Common alternatives to context The problem with passing props Passing props is a great way to explicitly pipe data through your UI tree to the components that use it. But passing props can become verbose and inconvenient when you need to pass some prop deeply through the tree, or if many components need the same prop. The nearest common ancestor could be far removed from the components that need data, and lifting state up that high can lead to a situation called “prop drilling”. Lifting state up Prop drilling Wouldn’t it be great if there were a way to “teleport” data to the components in the tree that need it without passing props? With React’s context feature, there is! Context: an alternative to passing props Context lets a parent component provide data to the entire tree below it. There are many uses for context. Here is one example. Consider this Heading component that accepts a level for its size: App.js Section.js Heading.js App.js Reset Fork import Heading from './Heading.js'; import Section from './Section.js'; export default function Page() { return ( <Section> <Heading level={1}>Title</Heading> <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading> <Heading level={3}>Sub-heading</Heading> <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading> <Heading level={5}>Sub-sub-sub-heading</Heading> <Heading level={6}>Sub-sub-sub-sub-heading</Heading> </Section> ); } Let’s say you want multiple headings within the same Section to always have the same size: App.js Section.js Heading.js App.js Reset Fork import Heading from './Heading.js'; import Section from './Section.js'; export default function Page() { return ( <Section> <Heading level={1}>Title</Heading> <Section> <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading> <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading> <Heading level={2}>Heading</Heading> <Section> <Heading level={3}>Sub-heading</Heading> <Heading level={3}>Sub-heading</Heading> <Heading level={3}>Sub-heading</Heading>\"),\n",

This way you could enforce that all headings in the same section have the same size: <code_snipet> <Section level={3}> <Heading>About</Heading> <Heading>Photos</Heading> <Heading>Videos</Heading></Section> </code_snipet> But how can the <Heading> component know the level of its closest <Section> ? That would require some way for a child to “ask” for data from somewhere above in the tree. You can’t do it with props alone. This is where context comes into play. You will do it in three steps: Create a context. (You can call it LevelContext , since it’s for the heading level.) Use that context from the component that needs the data. ( Heading will use LevelContext .) Provide that context from the component that specifies the data. ( Section will provide LevelContext .) Context lets a parent—even a distant one!—provide some data to the entire tree inside of it. Using context in close children Using context in distant children Step 1: Create the context First, you need to create the context. You’ll need to export it from a file so that your components can use it: App.js Section.js Heading.js LevelContext.js LevelContext.js Reset Fork import { createContext } from 'react'; export const LevelContext = createContext(1); The only argument to\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"can use it: App.js Section.js Heading.js LevelContext.js LevelContext.js Reset Fork import { createContext } from 'react'; export const LevelContext = createContext(1); The only argument to createContext is the default value. Here, 1 refers to the biggest heading level, but you could pass any kind of value (even an object). You will see the significance of the default value in the next step. Step 2: Use the context Import the useContext Hook from React and your context: <code_snipet> import { useContext } from 'react';import { LevelContext } from './LevelContext.js'; </code_snipet> Currently, the Heading component reads level from props: <code_snipet> export default function Heading({ level, children }) { // ...} </code_snipet> Instead, remove the level prop and read the value from the context you just imported, LevelContext : <code_snipet> export default function Heading({ children }) { const level = useContext(LevelContext); // ...} </code_snipet> useContext is a Hook. Just like useState and useReducer , you can only call a Hook immediately inside a React component (not inside loops or conditions). useContext tells React that the Heading component wants to read the LevelContext . Now that the Heading component doesn’t have a level prop, you don’t need to pass the level prop to Heading in your JSX like this anymore: <code_snipet> <Section> <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading> <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading> <Heading level={4}>Sub-sub-heading</Heading></Section> </code_snipet> Update the JSX so that it’s the Section that receives it instead: <code_snipet> <Section level={4}> <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading> <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading> <Heading>Sub-sub-heading</Heading></Section> </code_snipet> As a reminder, this is the markup that you were trying to get working: App.js Section.js Heading.js LevelContext.js App.js Reset Fork import Heading from './Heading.js'; import Section from './Section.js'; export default function Page() { return\"),\n",

All the headings have the same size because even though you’re using the context, you have not provided it yet. React doesn’t know where to get it! If you don’t provide the context, React will use the default value you’ve specified in the previous step. In this example, you specified 1 as the argument to createContext , so useContext(LevelContext) returns 1 , setting all those headings to <h1> . Let’s fix this problem by having each Section provide its own context. Step 3: Provide the context The Section component currently renders its children: <code_snipet> export default function Section({ children }) { return ( <section className=\"section\"> {children} </section> );} </code_snipet> Wrap them with a context provider to provide the LevelContext to them: <code_snipet> import { LevelContext } from \\'./LevelContext.js\\';export default function Section({ level, children }) { return ( <section className=\"section\"> <LevelContext.Provider value={level}> {children} </LevelContext.Provider> </section> );} </code_snipet> This tells React: “if any component inside this <Section> asks for LevelContext , give them this level .” The component will use the value of the nearest <LevelContext.Provider> in the UI tree above it. App.js Section.js Heading.js LevelContext.js App.js Reset Fork import Heading from'),\n",

Instead, it “figures out” its heading level by asking the closest Section above: You pass a level prop to the <Section> . Section wraps its children into <LevelContext.Provider value={level}> . Heading asks the closest value of LevelContext above with useContext(LevelContext) . Using and providing context from the same component Currently, you still have to specify each section’s level manually: <code_snipet> export default function Page() { return ( <Section level={1}> ... <Section level={2}> ... <Section level={3}> ... </code_snipet> Since context lets you read information from a component above, each Section could read the level from the Section above, and pass level + 1 down automatically. Here is how you could do it: <code_snipet> import { useContext } from \\'react\\';import { LevelContext } from \\'./LevelContext.js\\';export default function Section({ children }) { const level = useContext(LevelContext); return ( <section className=\"section\"> <LevelContext.Provider value={level + 1}> {children} </LevelContext.Provider> </section> );} </code_snipet> With this change, you don’t need to pass the level prop either to the <Section> or'),\n",

And the Section wraps its children into the LevelContext to specify that anything inside of it is at a “deeper” level. Note This example uses heading levels because they show visually how nested components can override context. But context is useful for many other use cases too. You can pass down any information needed by the entire subtree: the current color theme, the currently logged in user, and so on. Context passes through intermediate components You can insert as many components as you like between the component that provides context and the one that uses it. This includes both built-in components like <div> and components you might build yourself. In this example, the same Post component (with a dashed border) is rendered at two different nesting levels. Notice that the <Heading> inside of it gets its level automatically from the closest <Section> : App.js Section.js Heading.js LevelContext.js App.js Reset Fork import Heading from \\'./Heading.js\\'; import Section from \\'./Section.js\\'; export default function ProfilePage() { return ( <Section> <Heading>My Profile</Heading> <Post title=\"Hello'),\n",

A Section specifies the context for the tree inside it, so you can insert a <Heading> anywhere, and it will have the correct size. Try it in the sandbox above! Context lets you write components that “adapt to their surroundings” and display themselves differently depending on where (or, in other words, in which context ) they are being rendered. How context works might remind you of CSS property inheritance. In CSS, you can specify color: blue for a <div> , and any DOM node inside of it, no matter how deep, will inherit that color unless some other DOM node in the middle overrides it with color: green . Similarly, in React, the only way to override some context coming from above is to wrap children into a context provider with a different value. In CSS, different properties like color and background-color don’t override each other. You can set all <div> ’s color to red without impacting background-color . Similarly, different React contexts don’t override each other. Each context that you make with createContext() is completely separate from other ones, and ties together components using and providing that particular context. One component may use or provide many different contexts'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='make with createContext() is completely separate from other ones, and ties together components using and providing that particular context. One component may use or provide many different contexts without a problem. Before you use context Context is very tempting to use! However, this also means it’s too easy to overuse it. Just because you need to pass some props several levels deep doesn’t mean you should put that information into context. Here’s a few alternatives you should consider before using context: Start by passing props. If your components are not trivial, it’s not unusual to pass a dozen props down through a dozen components. It may feel like a slog, but it makes it very clear which components use which data! The person maintaining your code will be glad you’ve made the data flow explicit with props. Extract components and pass JSX as children to them. If you pass some data through many layers of intermediate components that don’t use that data (and only pass it further down), this often means that you forgot to extract some components along the way. For example, maybe you pass data props like posts to visual components that don’t use them directly, like <Layout posts={posts} /> . Instead, make Layout take children as a prop, and render <Layout><Posts posts={posts} /></Layout> . This reduces the number of layers between the component specifying the data and the one that needs it. If neither of these approaches works well for you, consider context. Use cases for context Theming: If your app lets the user change its appearance (e.g. dark mode), you can put a context provider at the top of your app, and use that context in components that need to adjust their visual look. Current account: Many components might need to know the currently logged in user. Putting it in context makes it convenient to read it anywhere in the tree. Some apps also let you operate multiple accounts at the same time (e.g. to leave a comment as a different user). In those cases, it'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='it in context makes it convenient to read it anywhere in the tree. Some apps also let you operate multiple accounts at the same time (e.g. to leave a comment as a different user). In those cases, it can be convenient to wrap a part of the UI into a nested provider with a different current account value. Routing: Most routing solutions use context internally to hold the current route. This is how every link “knows” whether it’s active or not. If you build your own router, you might want to do it too. Managing state: As your app grows, you might end up with a lot of state closer to the top of your app. Many distant components below may want to change it. It is common to use a reducer together with context to manage complex state and pass it down to distant components without too much hassle. Context is not limited to static values. If you pass a different value on the next render, React will update all the components reading it below! This is why context is often used in combination with state. In general, if some information is needed by distant components in different parts of the tree, it’s a good indication that context will help you. Recap Context lets a component provide some information to the entire tree below it. To pass context: Create and export it with export const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue) . Pass it to the useContext(MyContext) Hook to read it in any child component, no matter how deep. Wrap children into <MyContext.Provider value={...}> to provide it from a parent. Context passes through any components in the middle. Context lets you write components that “adapt to their surroundings”. Before you use context, try passing props or passing JSX as children .

However, as your app grows, you might run into another difficulty. Currently, the tasks state and the dispatch function are only available in the top-level TaskApp component. To let other components read the list of tasks or change it, you have to explicitly pass down the current state and the event handlers that change it as props.

This way, any component below TaskApp in the tree can read the tasks and dispatch actions without the repetitive “prop drilling”. Here is how you can combine a reducer with context: Create the context. Put state and dispatch into context. Use context anywhere in the tree. Step 1: Create the context The useReducer Hook returns the current tasks and the dispatch function that lets you update them: <code_snipet> const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks); </code_snipet> To pass them down the tree, you will create two separate contexts: TasksContext provides the current list of tasks.

But its tasks and dispatch are now available to every component below in the tree by importing and using these contexts. Moving all wiring into a single file You don’t have to do this, but you could further declutter the components by moving both reducer and context into a single file. Currently, TasksContext.js contains only two context declarations: <code_snipet> import { createContext } from \\'react\\';export const TasksContext = createContext(null);export const TasksDispatchContext = createContext(null); </code_snipet> This file is about to get crowded! You’ll move the reducer into that same file. Then you’ll declare a new TasksProvider component in the same file. This component will tie all the pieces together: It will manage the state with a reducer. It will provide both contexts to components below. It will take children as a prop so you can pass JSX to it. <code_snipet> export function TasksProvider({ children }) { const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks); return ( <TasksContext.Provider value={tasks}>'),\n",

Now all of the context and reducer wiring is in TasksContext.js .

Note Functions like useTasks and useTasksDispatch are called Custom Hooks. Your function is considered a custom Hook if its name starts with use . This lets you use other Hooks, like useContext , inside it. As your app grows, you may have many context-reducer pairs like this. This is a powerful way to scale your app and lift state up without too much work whenever you want to access the data deep in the tree. Recap You can combine reducer with context to let any component read and update state above it. To provide state and the dispatch function to components below: Create two contexts (for state and for dispatch functions). Provide both contexts from the component that uses the reducer. Use either context from components that need to read them. You can further declutter the components by moving all wiring into one file.

This value is intentionally mutable, meaning you can both read and write to it. It’s like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn’t track. (This is what makes it an “escape hatch” from React’s one-way data flow—more on that below!) Here, a button will increment ref.current on every click: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useRef } from 'react'; export default function Counter() { let ref = useRef(0); function handleClick() { ref.current = ref.current + 1; alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!'); } return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> Click me! </button> ); } Show more The ref points to a number, but, like state , you could point to anything: a string, an object, or even a function. Unlike state, ref is a plain JavaScript object with the current property that you can read and modify. Note that the component doesn’t re-render with every increment. Like state, refs are retained by React between re-renders. However, setting state re-renders a component. Changing a ref does not! Example: building a stopwatch You can combine refs and state in a single component. For example, let’s make a stopwatch that the user can start or stop by pressing a button. In order to display how much time has passed since the user pressed “Start”, you will need to keep track of when the Start button was pressed and what the current time is. This information is used for rendering, so you’ll keep it in state: <code_snipet> const [startTime, setStartTime] = useState(null);const [now, setNow] = useState(null); </code_snipet> When the user presses “Start”, you’ll use setInterval in\"),\n",

You can do this by calling clearInterval , but you need to give it the interval ID that was previously returned by the setInterval call when the user pressed Start. You need to keep the interval ID somewhere. Since the interval ID is not used for rendering, you can keep it in a ref: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useRef } from 'react'; export default function Stopwatch() { const [startTime, setStartTime] = useState(null); const [now, setNow] = useState(null); const intervalRef = useRef(null); function handleStart() { setStartTime(Date.now()); setNow(Date.now()); clearInterval(intervalRef.current); intervalRef.current = setInterval(() => { setNow(Date.now()); }, 10); } function handleStop() { clearInterval(intervalRef.current); } let secondsPassed = 0; if (startTime != null && now != null) { secondsPassed = (now - startTime) / 1000; } return ( <> <h1>Time passed: {secondsPassed.toFixed(3)}</h1> <button onClick={handleStart}> Start </button> <button onClick={handleStop}> Stop </button> </> ); } Show\"),\n",

When a piece of information is only needed by event handlers and changing it doesn’t require a re-render, using a ref may be more efficient. Differences between refs and state Perhaps you’re thinking refs seem less “strict” than state—you can mutate them instead of always having to use a state setting function, for instance. But in most cases, you’ll want to use state. Refs are an “escape hatch” you won’t need often. Here’s how state and refs compare: refs state useRef(initialValue) returns { current: initialValue } useState(initialValue) returns the current value of a state variable and a state setter function ( [value, setValue] ) Doesn’t trigger re-render when you change it. Triggers re-render when you change it. Mutable—you can modify and update current ’s value outside of the rendering process. ”Immutable”—you must use the state setting function to modify state variables to queue a re-render. You shouldn’t read (or write) the current value during rendering. You can read state at any time. However, each render has its own snapshot of state which does not change. Here is a counter button that’s implemented with state: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState } from 'react'; export default function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function handleClick() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> You clicked {count} times </button> ); } Because the count value is displayed, it makes sense to use a state value for it. When the counter’s value is set with setCount() , React re-renders the component and the screen updates to reflect the new count. If you tried to implement this with a ref, React would never re-render the component, so you’d never see the count\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\", React re-renders the component and the screen updates to reflect the new count. If you tried to implement this with a ref, React would never re-render the component, so you’d never see the count change! See how clicking this button does not update its text : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useRef } from 'react'; export default function Counter() { let countRef = useRef(0); function handleClick() { // This doesn't re-render the component! countRef.current = countRef.current + 1; } return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> You clicked {countRef.current} times </button> ); } Show more This is why reading ref.current during render leads to unreliable code. If you need that, use state instead. Deep Dive How does useRef work inside? Show Details Although both useState and useRef are provided by React, in principle useRef could be implemented on top of useState . You can imagine that inside of React, useRef is implemented like this: <code_snipet> // Inside of Reactfunction useRef(initialValue) { const [ref, unused] = useState({ current: initialValue }); return ref;} </code_snipet> During the first render, useRef returns { current: initialValue } . This object is stored by React, so during the next render the same object will be returned. Note how the state setter is unused in this example. It is unnecessary because useRef always needs to return the same object! React provides a built-in version of useRef because it is common enough in practice. But you can think of it as a regular state variable without a setter. If you’re familiar with object-oriented programming, refs might remind you of instance fields—but instead of this.something you write somethingRef.current . When to use refs Typically, you will use a ref when your component needs to “step outside” React and communicate with external APIs—often a browser API that won’t impact the appearance of the component. Here are a few of these rare situations: Storing timeout IDs Storing and manipulating DOM elements ,\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='with external APIs—often a browser API that won’t impact the appearance of the component. Here are a few of these rare situations: Storing timeout IDs Storing and manipulating DOM elements , which we cover on the next page Storing other objects that aren’t necessary to calculate the JSX. If your component needs to store some value, but it doesn’t impact the rendering logic, choose refs. Best practices for refs Following these principles will make your components more predictable: Treat refs as an escape hatch. Refs are useful when you work with external systems or browser APIs. If much of your application logic and data flow relies on refs, you might want to rethink your approach. Don’t read or write ref.current during rendering. If some information is needed during rendering, use state instead. Since React doesn’t know when ref.current changes, even reading it while rendering makes your component’s behavior difficult to predict. (The only exception to this is code like if (!ref.current) ref.current = new Thing() which only sets the ref once during the first render.) Limitations of React state don’t apply to refs. For example, state acts like a snapshot for every render and doesn’t update synchronously. But when you mutate the current value of a ref, it changes immediately: <code_snipet> ref.current = 5;console.log(ref.current); // 5 </code_snipet> This is because the ref itself is a regular JavaScript object, and so it behaves like one. You also don’t need to worry about avoiding mutation when you work with a ref. As long as the object you’re mutating isn’t used for rendering, React doesn’t care what you do with the ref or its contents. Refs and the DOM You can point a ref to any value. However, the most common use case for a ref is to access a DOM element. For example, this is handy if you want to focus an input programmatically. When you pass a ref to a ref attribute in JSX, like <div ref={myRef}> , React will put the corresponding DOM element into myRef.current'),\n",

Once the element is removed from the DOM, React will update myRef.current to be null . You can read more about this in Manipulating the DOM with Refs. Recap Refs are an escape hatch to hold onto values that aren’t used for rendering. You won’t need them often. A ref is a plain JavaScript object with a single property called current , which you can read or set. You can ask React to give you a ref by calling the useRef Hook. Like state, refs let you retain information between re-renders of a component. Unlike state, setting the ref’s current value does not trigger a re-render. Don’t read or write ref.current during rendering. This makes your component hard to predict. Try out some challenges 1 . Fix a broken chat input 2 . Fix a component failing to re-render 3 .

You can’t call useRef in a loop, in a condition, or inside a map() call. One possible way around this is to get a single ref to their parent element, and then use DOM manipulation methods like querySelectorAll to “find” the individual child nodes from it. However, this is brittle and can break if your DOM structure changes. Another solution is to pass a function to the ref attribute. This is called a ref callback. React will call your ref callback with the DOM node when it’s time to set the ref, and with null when it’s time to clear it. This lets you maintain your own array or a Map , and access any ref by its index or some kind of ID. This example shows how you can use this approach to scroll to an arbitrary node in a long list: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useRef, useState } from \"react\"; export default function CatFriends() { const itemsRef = useRef(null); const [catList, setCatList] = useState(setupCatList); function scrollToCat(cat) { const map = getMap(); const node = map.get(cat); node.scrollIntoView({ behavior: \"smooth\", block: \"nearest\", inline: \"center\", }); } function getMap() { if (!itemsRef.current) { // Initialize the Map on first usage. itemsRef.current = new Map(); } return itemsRef.current; } return ( <> <nav> <button onClick={() => scrollToCat(catList[0])}>Neo</button> <button onClick={() => scrollToCat(catList[5])}>Millie</button> <button onClick={() => scrollToCat(catList[9])}>Bella</button> </nav> <div> <ul> {catList.map((cat) => ( <li key={cat} ref={(node) => { const map = getMap(); map.set(cat, node); return () => { map.delete(cat); }; }} > <img src={cat} /> </li> ))} </ul> </div> </> ); } function setupCatList() { const catList = []; for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { catList.push(\" + i); } return catList; } Show more In this example, itemsRef doesn’t hold a single DOM'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='</div> </> ); } function setupCatList() { const catList = []; for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { catList.push(\" + i); } return catList; } Show more In this example, itemsRef doesn’t hold a single DOM node. Instead, it holds a Map from item ID to a DOM node. ( Refs can hold any values! ) The ref callback on every list item takes care to update the Map: <code_snipet> <li key={cat.id} ref={node => { const map = getMap(); // Add to the Map map.set(cat, node); return () => { // Remove from the Map map.delete(cat); }; }}> </code_snipet> This lets you read individual DOM nodes from the Map later. Note When Strict Mode is enabled, ref callbacks will run twice in development. Read more about how this helps find bugs in callback refs. Accessing another component’s DOM nodes Pitfall Refs are an escape hatch. Manually manipulating another component’s DOM nodes can make your code fragile. You can pass refs from parent component to child components just like any other prop . <code_snipet> import { useRef } from \\'react\\';function MyInput({ ref }) { return <input ref={ref} />;}function MyForm() { const inputRef = useRef(null); return <MyInput ref={inputRef} />} </code_snipet> In the above example, a ref is created in the parent component, MyForm , and is passed to the child component, MyInput . MyInput then passes the ref to <input> . Because <input> is a built-in component React sets the .current property of the ref to the <input> DOM element. The inputRef created in MyForm now points to the <input> DOM element returned by MyInput . A click handler created in MyForm can access inputRef and call focus() to set the focus on <input> . App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useRef } from \\'react\\'; function MyInput({ ref }) { return <input ref={ref} />; } export default function MyForm() { const inputRef = useRef(null); function handleClick() { inputRef.current.focus(); } return ( <> <MyInput ref={inputRef} /> <button onClick={handleClick}> Focus the input </button> </> ); } Show more Deep Dive'),\n",

This lets the parent component call focus() on it. However, this also lets the parent component do something else—for example, change its CSS styles. In uncommon cases, you may want to restrict the exposed functionality. You can do that with useImperativeHandle : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from \"react\"; function MyInput({ ref }) { const realInputRef = useRef(null); useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({ // Only expose focus and nothing else focus() { realInputRef.current.focus(); }, })); return <input ref={realInputRef} />; }; export default function Form() { const inputRef = useRef(null); function handleClick() { inputRef.current.focus(); } return ( <> <MyInput ref={inputRef} /> <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus the input</button> </> ); } Show more Here, realInputRef inside MyInput holds the actual input DOM node. However, useImperativeHandle instructs React to provide your own special object as the value of a ref to the parent component. So inputRef.current inside the Form component will only have the focus method. In this case, the ref “handle” is not the DOM node, but the custom object you create inside useImperativeHandle call. When React attaches the refs In React, every update is split in two phases : During render, React calls your components to figure out what should be on the screen. During commit, React applies changes to the DOM. In general, you don’t want to access refs during rendering. That goes for refs holding DOM nodes as well. During the first render, the DOM nodes have not yet been created, so ref.current will be null . And during the rendering of updates, the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"rendering. That goes for refs holding DOM nodes as well. During the first render, the DOM nodes have not yet been created, so ref.current will be null . And during the rendering of updates, the DOM nodes haven’t been updated yet. So it’s too early to read them. React sets ref.current during the commit. Before updating the DOM, React sets the affected ref.current values to null . After updating the DOM, React immediately sets them to the corresponding DOM nodes. Usually, you will access refs from event handlers. If you want to do something with a ref, but there is no particular event to do it in, you might need an Effect. We will discuss Effects on the next pages. Deep Dive Flushing state updates synchronously with flushSync Show Details Consider code like this, which adds a new todo and scrolls the screen down to the last child of the list. Notice how, for some reason, it always scrolls to the todo that was just before the last added one: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useRef } from 'react'; export default function TodoList() { const listRef = useRef(null); const [text, setText] = useState(''); const [todos, setTodos] = useState( initialTodos ); function handleAdd() { const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text: text }; setText(''); setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]); listRef.current.lastChild.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'nearest' }); } return ( <> <button onClick={handleAdd}> Add </button> <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> <ul ref={listRef}> {todos.map(todo => ( <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li> ))} </ul> </> ); } let nextId = 0; let initialTodos = []; for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) { initialTodos.push({ id: nextId++, text: 'Todo #' + (i + 1) }); } Show more The issue is with these two lines: <code_snipet> setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]);listRef.current.lastChild.scrollIntoView(); </code_snipet> In React, state updates are queued.

However, here it causes a problem because setTodos does not immediately update the DOM. So the time you scroll the list to its last element, the todo has not yet been added. This is why scrolling always “lags behind” by one item. To fix this issue, you can force React to update (“flush”) the DOM synchronously. To do this, import flushSync from react-dom and wrap the state update into a flushSync call: <code_snipet> flushSync(() => { setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]);});listRef.current.lastChild.scrollIntoView(); </code_snipet> This will instruct React to update the DOM synchronously right after the code wrapped in flushSync executes. As a result, the last todo will already be in the DOM by the time you try to scroll to it: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useRef } from 'react'; import { flushSync } from 'react-dom'; export default function TodoList() { const listRef = useRef(null); const [text, setText] = useState(''); const [todos, setTodos] = useState( initialTodos ); function handleAdd() { const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text: text }; flushSync(() => { setText(''); setTodos([ ...todos, newTodo]); }); listRef.current.lastChild.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'nearest' }); } return ( <> <button onClick={handleAdd}> Add </button> <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> <ul ref={listRef}> {todos.map(todo => ( <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li> ))} </ul> </> ); } let nextId = 0; let initialTodos = []; for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) { initialTodos.push({ id: nextId++, text: 'Todo #' + (i + 1) }); } Show more Best practices for DOM manipulation with refs Refs are an escape hatch.

Common examples of this include managing focus, scroll position, or calling browser APIs that React does not expose. If you stick to non-destructive actions like focusing and scrolling, you shouldn’t encounter any problems. However, if you try to modify the DOM manually, you can risk conflicting with the changes React is making. To illustrate this problem, this example includes a welcome message and two buttons. The first button toggles its presence using conditional rendering and state , as you would usually do in React. The second button uses the remove() DOM API to forcefully remove it from the DOM outside of React’s control. Try pressing “Toggle with setState” a few times. The message should disappear and appear again. Then press “Remove from the DOM”. This will forcefully remove it. Finally, press “Toggle with setState”: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useRef } from 'react'; export default function Counter() { const [show, setShow] = useState(true); const ref = useRef(null); return ( <div> <button onClick={() => { setShow(!show); }}> Toggle with setState </button> <button onClick={() => { ref.current.remove(); }}> Remove from the DOM </button> {show && <p ref={ref}>Hello world</p>} </div> ); } Show more After you’ve manually removed the DOM element, trying to use setState to show it again will lead to a crash. This is because you’ve changed the DOM, and React doesn’t know how to continue managing it correctly. Avoid changing DOM nodes managed by React. Modifying, adding children to, or removing children from elements that are managed by React can lead to inconsistent visual results or crashes like above. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t do it at all. It requires caution. You can safely modify parts of the DOM that React has no reason to update.

Recap Refs are a generic concept, but most often you’ll use them to hold DOM elements. You instruct React to put a DOM node into myRef.current by passing <div ref={myRef}> . Usually, you will use refs for non-destructive actions like focusing, scrolling, or measuring DOM elements. A component doesn’t expose its DOM nodes by default. You can opt into exposing a DOM node by using forwardRef and passing the second ref argument down to a specific node. Avoid changing DOM nodes managed by React. If you do modify DOM nodes managed by React, modify parts that React has no reason to update. Try out some challenges 1 . Play and pause the video 2 . Focus the search field 3 . Scrolling an image carousel 4 . Focus the search field with separate components Challenge 1 of 4 : Play and pause the video In this example, the button toggles a state variable to switch between a playing and a paused state. However, in order to actually play or pause the video, toggling state is not enough. You also need to call play() and pause() on the DOM element for the <video> . Add a ref to it, and make the button work.

Learn React Escape Hatches Synchronizing with Effects Some components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. Effects let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='to skip re-running an Effect unnecessarily Why Effects run twice in development and how to fix them What are Effects and how are they different from events? Before getting to Effects, you need to be familiar with two types of logic inside React components: Rendering code (introduced in Describing the UI ) lives at the top level of your component. This is where you take the props and state, transform them, and return the JSX you want to see on the screen. Rendering code must be pure. Like a math formula, it should only calculate the result, but not do anything else. Event handlers (introduced in Adding Interactivity ) are nested functions inside your components that do things rather than just calculate them. An event handler might update an input field, submit an HTTP POST request to buy a product, or navigate the user to another screen. Event handlers contain “side effects” (they change the program’s state) caused by a specific user action (for example, a button click or typing). Sometimes this isn’t enough. Consider a ChatRoom component that must connect to the chat server whenever it’s visible on the screen. Connecting to a server is not a pure calculation (it’s a side effect) so it can’t happen during rendering. However, there is no single particular event like a click that causes ChatRoom to be displayed. Effects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event. Sending a message in the chat is an event because it is directly caused by the user clicking a specific button. However, setting up a server connection is an Effect because it should happen no matter which interaction caused the component to appear. Effects run at the end of a commit after the screen updates. This is a good time to synchronize the React components with some external system (like network or a third-party library). Note Here and later in this text, capitalized “Effect” refers to the React-specific definition above, i.e. a side effect'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"components with some external system (like network or a third-party library). Note Here and later in this text, capitalized “Effect” refers to the React-specific definition above, i.e. a side effect caused by rendering. To refer to the broader programming concept, we’ll say “side effect”. You might not need an Effect Don’t rush to add Effects to your components. Keep in mind that Effects are typically used to “step out” of your React code and synchronize with some external system. This includes browser APIs, third-party widgets, network, and so on. If your Effect only adjusts some state based on other state, you might not need an Effect. How to write an Effect To write an Effect, follow these three steps: Declare an Effect. By default, your Effect will run after every commit . Specify the Effect dependencies. Most Effects should only re-run when needed rather than after every render. For example, a fade-in animation should only trigger when a component appears. Connecting and disconnecting to a chat room should only happen when the component appears and disappears, or when the chat room changes. You will learn how to control this by specifying dependencies. Add cleanup if needed. Some Effects need to specify how to stop, undo, or clean up whatever they were doing. For example, “connect” needs “disconnect”, “subscribe” needs “unsubscribe”, and “fetch” needs either “cancel” or “ignore”. You will learn how to do this by returning a cleanup function . Let’s look at each of these steps in detail. Step 1: Declare an Effect To declare an Effect in your component, import the useEffect Hook from React: <code_snipet> import { useEffect } from 'react'; </code_snipet> Then, call it at the top level of your component and put some code inside your Effect: <code_snipet> function MyComponent() { useEffect(() => { // Code here will run after *every* render }); return <div />;} </code_snipet> Every time your component renders, React will update the screen and then run the code\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='MyComponent() { useEffect(() => { // Code here will run after *every* render }); return <div />;} </code_snipet> Every time your component renders, React will update the screen and then run the code inside useEffect . In other words, useEffect “delays” a piece of code from running until that render is reflected on the screen. Let’s see how you can use an Effect to synchronize with an external system. Consider a <VideoPlayer> React component. It would be nice to control whether it’s playing or paused by passing an isPlaying prop to it: <code_snipet> <VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} />; </code_snipet> Your custom VideoPlayer component renders the built-in browser <video> tag: <code_snipet> function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { // TODO: do something with isPlaying return <video src={src} />;} </code_snipet> However, the browser <video> tag does not have an isPlaying prop. The only way to control it is to manually call the play() and pause() methods on the DOM element. You need to synchronize the value of isPlaying prop, which tells whether the video should currently be playing, with calls like play() and pause() . We’ll need to first get a ref to the <video> DOM node. You might be tempted to try to call play() or pause() during rendering, but that isn’t correct: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { const ref = useRef(null); if (isPlaying) { ref.current.play(); // Calling these while rendering isn\\'t allowed. } else { ref.current.pause(); // Also, this crashes. } return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />; } export default function App() { const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false); return ( <> <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}> {isPlaying ? \\'Pause\\' : \\'Play\\'} </button> <VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} src=\" /> </> ); } Show more The reason this code isn’t correct is that it tries to do something with the DOM node during rendering. In React,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=': \\'Play\\'} </button> <VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} src=\" /> </> ); } Show more The reason this code isn’t correct is that it tries to do something with the DOM node during rendering. In React, rendering should be a pure calculation of JSX and should not contain side effects like modifying the DOM. Moreover, when VideoPlayer is called for the first time, its DOM does not exist yet! There isn’t a DOM node yet to call play() or pause() on, because React doesn’t know what DOM to create until you return the JSX. The solution here is to wrap the side effect with useEffect to move it out of the rendering calculation: <code_snipet> import { useEffect, useRef } from \\'react\\';function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { const ref = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { if (isPlaying) { ref.current.play(); } else { ref.current.pause(); } }); return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />;} </code_snipet> By wrapping the DOM update in an Effect, you let React update the screen first. Then your Effect runs. When your VideoPlayer component renders (either the first time or if it re-renders), a few things will happen. First, React will update the screen, ensuring the <video> tag is in the DOM with the right props. Then React will run your Effect. Finally, your Effect will call play() or pause() depending on the value of isPlaying . Press Play/Pause multiple times and see how the video player stays synchronized to the isPlaying value: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { const ref = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { if (isPlaying) { ref.current.play(); } else { ref.current.pause(); } }); return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />; } export default function App() { const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false); return ( <> <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}> {isPlaying ? \\'Pause\\' : \\'Play\\'} </button> <VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} src=\" /> </> ); } Show more In this'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='= useState(false); return ( <> <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}> {isPlaying ? \\'Pause\\' : \\'Play\\'} </button> <VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} src=\" /> </> ); } Show more In this example, the “external system” you synchronized to React state was the browser media API. You can use a similar approach to wrap legacy non-React code (like jQuery plugins) into declarative React components. Note that controlling a video player is much more complex in practice. Calling play() may fail, the user might play or pause using the built-in browser controls, and so on. This example is very simplified and incomplete. Pitfall By default, Effects run after every render. This is why code like this will produce an infinite loop: <code_snipet> const [count, setCount] = useState(0);useEffect(() => { setCount(count + 1);}); </code_snipet> Effects run as a result of rendering. Setting state triggers rendering. Setting state immediately in an Effect is like plugging a power outlet into itself. The Effect runs, it sets the state, which causes a re-render, which causes the Effect to run, it sets the state again, this causes another re-render, and so on. Effects should usually synchronize your components with an external system. If there’s no external system and you only want to adjust some state based on other state, you might not need an Effect. Step 2: Specify the Effect dependencies By default, Effects run after every render. Often, this is not what you want: Sometimes, it’s slow. Synchronizing with an external system is not always instant, so you might want to skip doing it unless it’s necessary. For example, you don’t want to reconnect to the chat server on every keystroke. Sometimes, it’s wrong. For example, you don’t want to trigger a component fade-in animation on every keystroke. The animation should only play once when the component appears for the first time. To demonstrate the issue, here is the previous example with a few console.log calls and a text input that'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='keystroke. The animation should only play once when the component appears for the first time.

Notice how typing causes the Effect to re-run: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { const ref = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { if (isPlaying) { console.log(\\'Calling video.play()\\'); ref.current.play(); } else { console.log(\\'Calling video.pause()\\'); ref.current.pause(); } }); return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />; } export default function App() { const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false); const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return ( <> <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}> {isPlaying ? \\'Pause\\' : \\'Play\\'} </button> <VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} src=\" /> </> ); } Show more You can tell React to skip unnecessarily re-running the Effect by specifying an array of dependencies as the second argument to the useEffect call. Start by adding an empty [] array to the above example on line 14: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { // ... }, []); </code_snipet> You should see an error saying React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: \\'isPlaying\\' : App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { const ref = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { if (isPlaying) { console.log(\\'Calling video.play()\\'); ref.current.play(); } else { console.log(\\'Calling video.pause()\\'); ref.current.pause(); } }, []); // This causes an error return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />; } export default function App() { const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false); const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return ( <> <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> <button onClick={() =>'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='App() { const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false); const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return ( <> <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}> {isPlaying ? \\'Pause\\' : \\'Play\\'} </button> <VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} src=\" /> </> ); } Show more The problem is that the code inside of your Effect depends on the isPlaying prop to decide what to do, but this dependency was not explicitly declared. To fix this issue, add isPlaying to the dependency array: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { if (isPlaying) { // It\\'s used here... // ... } else { // ... } }, [isPlaying]); // ...so it must be declared here! </code_snipet> Now all dependencies are declared, so there is no error. Specifying [isPlaying] as the dependency array tells React that it should skip re-running your Effect if isPlaying is the same as it was during the previous render. With this change, typing into the input doesn’t cause the Effect to re-run, but pressing Play/Pause does: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { const ref = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { if (isPlaying) { console.log(\\'Calling video.play()\\'); ref.current.play(); } else { console.log(\\'Calling video.pause()\\'); ref.current.pause(); } }, [isPlaying]); return <video ref={ref} src={src} loop playsInline />; } export default function App() { const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false); const [text, setText] = useState(\\'\\'); return ( <> <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> <button onClick={() => setIsPlaying(!isPlaying)}> {isPlaying ? \\'Pause\\' : \\'Play\\'} </button> <VideoPlayer isPlaying={isPlaying} src=\" /> </> ); } Show more The dependency array can contain multiple dependencies.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='dependencies. React will only skip re-running the Effect if all of the dependencies you specify have exactly the same values as they had during the previous render. React compares the dependency values using the Object.is comparison. See the useEffect reference for details. Notice that you can’t “choose” your dependencies. You will get a lint error if the dependencies you specified don’t match what React expects based on the code inside your Effect. This helps catch many bugs in your code. If you don’t want some code to re-run, edit the Effect code itself to not “need” that dependency. Pitfall The behaviors without the dependency array and with an empty [] dependency array are different: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { // This runs after every render});useEffect(() => { // This runs only on mount (when the component appears)}, []);useEffect(() => { // This runs on mount *and also* if either a or b have changed since the last render}, [a, b]); </code_snipet> We’ll take a close look at what “mount” means in the next step. Deep Dive Why was the ref omitted from the dependency array? Show Details This Effect uses both ref and isPlaying , but only isPlaying is declared as a dependency: <code_snipet> function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { const ref = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { if (isPlaying) { ref.current.play(); } else { ref.current.pause(); } }, [isPlaying]); </code_snipet> This is because the ref object has a stable identity: React guarantees you’ll always get the same object from the same useRef call on every render. It never changes, so it will never by itself cause the Effect to re-run. Therefore, it does not matter whether you include it or not. Including it is fine too: <code_snipet> function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { const ref = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { if (isPlaying) { ref.current.play(); } else { ref.current.pause(); } }, [isPlaying, ref]); </code_snipet> The set functions returned by useState also have stable identity, so you will'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='=> { if (isPlaying) { ref.current.play(); } else { ref.current.pause(); } }, [isPlaying, ref]); </code_snipet> The set functions returned by useState also have stable identity, so you will often see them omitted from the dependencies too. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Omitting always-stable dependencies only works when the linter can “see” that the object is stable. For example, if ref was passed from a parent component, you would have to specify it in the dependency array. However, this is good because you can’t know whether the parent component always passes the same ref, or passes one of several refs conditionally. So your Effect would depend on which ref is passed. Step 3: Add cleanup if needed Consider a different example. You’re writing a ChatRoom component that needs to connect to the chat server when it appears. You are given a createConnection() API that returns an object with connect() and disconnect() methods. How do you keep the component connected while it is displayed to the user? Start by writing the Effect logic: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(); connection.connect();}); </code_snipet> It would be slow to connect to the chat after every re-render, so you add the dependency array: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(); connection.connect();}, []); </code_snipet> The code inside the Effect does not use any props or state, so your dependency array is [] (empty). This tells React to only run this code when the component “mounts”, i.e. appears on the screen for the first time. Let’s try running this code: App.js chat.js App.js Reset Fork import { useEffect } from \\'react\\'; import { createConnection } from \\'./chat.js\\'; export default function ChatRoom() { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(); connection.connect(); }, []); return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>; } This Effect only runs on mount, so you might expect \"✅'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='ChatRoom() { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(); connection.connect(); }, []); return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>; } This Effect only runs on mount, so you might expect \"✅ Connecting...\" to be printed once in the console. However, if you check the console, \"✅ Connecting...\" gets printed twice. Why does it happen? Imagine the ChatRoom component is a part of a larger app with many different screens. The user starts their journey on the ChatRoom page. The component mounts and calls connection.connect() . Then imagine the user navigates to another screen—for example, to the Settings page. The ChatRoom component unmounts. Finally, the user clicks Back and ChatRoom mounts again. This would set up a second connection—but the first connection was never destroyed! As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up. Bugs like this are easy to miss without extensive manual testing. To help you spot them quickly, in development React remounts every component once immediately after its initial mount. Seeing the \"✅ Connecting...\" log twice helps you notice the real issue: your code doesn’t close the connection when the component unmounts. To fix the issue, return a cleanup function from your Effect: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, []); </code_snipet> React will call your cleanup function each time before the Effect runs again, and one final time when the component unmounts (gets removed). Let’s see what happens when the cleanup function is implemented: App.js chat.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; import { createConnection } from \\'./chat.js\\'; export default function ChatRoom() { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, []); return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>; } Now you get three console logs in development: \"✅'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='{ const connection = createConnection(); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, []); return <h1>Welcome to the chat!</h1>; } Now you get three console logs in development: \"✅ Connecting...\" \"❌ Disconnected.\" \"✅ Connecting...\" This is the correct behavior in development. By remounting your component, React verifies that navigating away and back would not break your code. Disconnecting and then connecting again is exactly what should happen! When you implement the cleanup well, there should be no user-visible difference between running the Effect once vs running it, cleaning it up, and running it again. There’s an extra connect/disconnect call pair because React is probing your code for bugs in development. This is normal—don’t try to make it go away! In production, you would only see \"✅ Connecting...\" printed once. Remounting components only happens in development to help you find Effects that need cleanup. You can turn off Strict Mode to opt out of the development behavior, but we recommend keeping it on. This lets you find many bugs like the one above. How to handle the Effect firing twice in development? React intentionally remounts your components in development to find bugs like in the last example. The right question isn’t “how to run an Effect once”, but “how to fix my Effect so that it works after remounting”. Usually, the answer is to implement the cleanup function. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the Effect was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the Effect running once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as you’d see in development). Most of the Effects you’ll write will fit into one of the common patterns below. Pitfall Don’t use refs to prevent Effects from firing A common pitfall for preventing Effects firing twice in development is to use a ref to prevent the Effect from running more than once. For example, you could “fix” the above bug with'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='from firing A common pitfall for preventing Effects firing twice in development is to use a ref to prevent the Effect from running more than once. For example, you could “fix” the above bug with a useRef : <code_snipet> const connectionRef = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { // 🚩 This wont fix the bug!!! if (!connectionRef.current) { connectionRef.current = createConnection(); connectionRef.current.connect(); } }, []); </code_snipet> This makes it so you only see \"✅ Connecting...\" once in development, but it doesn’t fix the bug. When the user navigates away, the connection still isn’t closed and when they navigate back, a new connection is created. As the user navigates across the app, the connections would keep piling up, the same as it would before the “fix”. To fix the bug, it is not enough to just make the Effect run once. The effect needs to work after re-mounting, which means the connection needs to be cleaned up like in the solution above. See the examples below for how to handle common patterns. Controlling non-React widgets Sometimes you need to add UI widgets that aren’t written in React. For example, let’s say you’re adding a map component to your page. It has a setZoomLevel() method, and you’d like to keep the zoom level in sync with a zoomLevel state variable in your React code. Your Effect would look similar to this: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { const map = mapRef.current; map.setZoomLevel(zoomLevel);}, [zoomLevel]); </code_snipet> Note that there is no cleanup needed in this case. In development, React will call the Effect twice, but this is not a problem because calling setZoomLevel twice with the same value does not do anything. It may be slightly slower, but this doesn’t matter because it won’t remount needlessly in production. Some APIs may not allow you to call them twice in a row. For example, the showModal method of the built-in <dialog> element throws if you call it twice. Implement the cleanup function and make it close the dialog:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"not allow you to call them twice in a row. For example, the showModal method of the built-in <dialog> element throws if you call it twice. Implement the cleanup function and make it close the dialog: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { const dialog = dialogRef.current; dialog.showModal(); return () => dialog.close();}, []); </code_snipet> In development, your Effect will call showModal() , then immediately close() , and then showModal() again. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling showModal() once, as you would see in production. Subscribing to events If your Effect subscribes to something, the cleanup function should unsubscribe: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { function handleScroll(e) { console.log(window.scrollX, window.scrollY); } window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll); return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);}, []); </code_snipet> In development, your Effect will call addEventListener() , then immediately removeEventListener() , and then addEventListener() again with the same handler. So there would be only one active subscription at a time. This has the same user-visible behavior as calling addEventListener() once, as in production. Triggering animations If your Effect animates something in, the cleanup function should reset the animation to the initial values: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { const node = ref.current; node.style.opacity = 1; // Trigger the animation return () => { node.style.opacity = 0; // Reset to the initial value };}, []); </code_snipet> In development, opacity will be set to 1 , then to 0 , and then to 1 again. This should have the same user-visible behavior as setting it to 1 directly, which is what would happen in production. If you use a third-party animation library with support for tweening, your cleanup function should reset the timeline to its initial state. Fetching data If your Effect fetches something, the cleanup function should either abort the fetch or ignore its result:\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"your cleanup function should reset the timeline to its initial state. Fetching data If your Effect fetches something, the cleanup function should either abort the fetch or ignore its result: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { let ignore = false; async function startFetching() { const json = await fetchTodos(userId); if (!ignore) { setTodos(json); } } startFetching(); return () => { ignore = true; };}, [userId]); </code_snipet> You can’t “undo” a network request that already happened, but your cleanup function should ensure that the fetch that’s not relevant anymore does not keep affecting your application. If the userId changes from 'Alice' to 'Bob' , cleanup ensures that the 'Alice' response is ignored even if it arrives after 'Bob' . In development, you will see two fetches in the Network tab. There is nothing wrong with that. With the approach above, the first Effect will immediately get cleaned up so its copy of the ignore variable will be set to true . So even though there is an extra request, it won’t affect the state thanks to the if (!ignore) check. In production, there will only be one request. If the second request in development is bothering you, the best approach is to use a solution that deduplicates requests and caches their responses between components: <code_snipet> function TodoList() { const todos = useSomeDataLibrary(`/api/user/${userId}/todos`); // ... </code_snipet> This will not only improve the development experience, but also make your application feel faster. For example, the user pressing the Back button won’t have to wait for some data to load again because it will be cached. You can either build such a cache yourself or use one of the many alternatives to manual fetching in Effects. Deep Dive What are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects?

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Show Details Writing fetch calls inside Effects is a popular way to fetch data , especially in fully client-side apps. This is, however, a very manual approach and it has significant downsides: Effects don’t run on the server. This means that the initial server-rendered HTML will only include a loading state with no data. The client computer will have to download all JavaScript and render your app only to discover that now it needs to load the data. This is not very efficient. Fetching directly in Effects makes it easy to create “network waterfalls”. You render the parent component, it fetches some data, renders the child components, and then they start fetching their data. If the network is not very fast, this is significantly slower than fetching all data in parallel. Fetching directly in Effects usually means you don’t preload or cache data. For example, if the component unmounts and then mounts again, it would have to fetch the data again. It’s not very ergonomic. There’s quite a bit of boilerplate code involved when writing fetch calls in a way that doesn’t suffer from bugs like race conditions. This list of downsides is not specific to React. It applies to fetching data on mount with any library. Like with routing, data fetching is not trivial to do well, so we recommend the following approaches: If you use a framework , use its built-in data fetching mechanism. Modern React frameworks have integrated data fetching mechanisms that are efficient and don’t suffer from the above pitfalls. Otherwise, consider using or building a client-side cache. Popular open source solutions include React Query , useSWR , and React Router 6.4+. You can build your own solution too, in which case you would use Effects under the hood, but add logic for deduplicating requests, caching responses, and avoiding network waterfalls (by preloading data or hoisting data requirements to routes). You can continue fetching data directly in Effects if neither of these approaches suit you.'),\n",

Sending analytics Consider this code that sends an analytics event on the page visit: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { logVisit(url); // Sends a POST request}, [url]); </code_snipet> In development, logVisit will be called twice for every URL, so you might be tempted to try to fix that. We recommend keeping this code as is. Like with earlier examples, there is no user-visible behavior difference between running it once and running it twice. From a practical point of view, logVisit should not do anything in development because you don’t want the logs from the development machines to skew the production metrics. Your component remounts every time you save its file, so it logs extra visits in development anyway. In production, there will be no duplicate visit logs. To debug the analytics events you’re sending, you can deploy your app to a staging environment (which runs in production mode) or temporarily opt out of Strict Mode and its development-only remounting checks. You may also send analytics from the route change event handlers instead of Effects. For more precise analytics, intersection observers can help track which components are in the viewport and how long they remain visible. Not an Effect: Initializing the application Some logic should only run once when the application starts. You can put it outside your components: <code_snipet> if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // Check if we're running in the browser. checkAuthToken(); loadDataFromLocalStorage();}function App() { // ...} </code_snipet> This guarantees that such logic only runs once after the browser loads the page.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"page.

For example, maybe your Effect sends a POST request like buying a product: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { // 🔴 Wrong: This Effect fires twice in development, exposing a problem in the code. fetch('/api/buy', { method: 'POST' });}, []); </code_snipet> You wouldn’t want to buy the product twice. However, this is also why you shouldn’t put this logic in an Effect. What if the user goes to another page and then presses Back? Your Effect would run again. You don’t want to buy the product when the user visits a page; you want to buy it when the user clicks the Buy button. Buying is not caused by rendering; it’s caused by a specific interaction. It should run only when the user presses the button. Delete the Effect and move your /api/buy request into the Buy button event handler: <code_snipet> function handleClick() { // ✅ Buying is an event because it is caused by a particular interaction. fetch('/api/buy', { method: 'POST' }); } </code_snipet> This illustrates that if remounting breaks the logic of your application, this usually uncovers existing bugs. From a user’s perspective, visiting a page shouldn’t be different from visiting it, clicking a link, then pressing Back to view the page again. React verifies that your components abide by this principle by remounting them once in development. Putting it all together This playground can help you “get a feel” for how Effects work in practice. This example uses setTimeout to schedule a console log with the input text to appear three seconds after the Effect runs. The cleanup function cancels the pending timeout. Start by pressing “Mount the component”: App.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; function Playground() { const [text, setText] = useState('a'); useEffect(() => { function onTimeout() { console.log('⏰ ' + text); }\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; function Playground() { const [text, setText] = useState(\\'a\\'); useEffect(() => { function onTimeout() { console.log(\\'⏰ \\' + text); } console.log(\\'🔵 Schedule \"\\' + text + \\'\" log\\'); const timeoutId = setTimeout(onTimeout, 3000); return () => { console.log(\\'🟡 Cancel \"\\' + text + \\'\" log\\'); clearTimeout(timeoutId); }; }, [text]); return ( <> <label> What to log:{\\' \\'} <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} /> </label> <h1>{text}</h1> </> ); } export default function App() { const [show, setShow] = useState(false); return ( <> <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}> {show ? \\'Unmount\\' : \\'Mount\\'} the component </button> {show && <hr />} {show && <Playground />} </> ); } Show more You will see three logs at first: Schedule \"a\" log , Cancel \"a\" log , and Schedule \"a\" log again. Three second later there will also be a log saying a . As you learned earlier, the extra schedule/cancel pair is because React remounts the component once in development to verify that you’ve implemented cleanup well. Now edit the input to say abc . If you do it fast enough, you’ll see Schedule \"ab\" log immediately followed by Cancel \"ab\" log and Schedule \"abc\" log . React always cleans up the previous render’s Effect before the next render’s Effect. This is why even if you type into the input fast, there is at most one timeout scheduled at a time. Edit the input a few times and watch the console to get a feel for how Effects get cleaned up. Type something into the input and then immediately press “Unmount the component”. Notice how unmounting cleans up the last render’s Effect. Here, it clears the last timeout before it has a chance to fire. Finally, edit the component above and comment out the cleanup function so that the timeouts don’t get cancelled. Try typing abcde fast. What do you expect to happen in three seconds? Will console.log(text) inside the timeout print the latest text and produce five abcde logs? Give it a'),\n",

Will console.log(text) inside the timeout print the latest text and produce five abcde logs? Give it a try to check your intuition! Three seconds later, you should see a sequence of logs ( a , ab , abc , abcd , and abcde ) rather than five abcde logs. Each Effect “captures” the text value from its corresponding render. It doesn’t matter that the text state changed: an Effect from the render with text = \\'ab\\' will always see \\'ab\\' . In other words, Effects from each render are isolated from each other. If you’re curious how this works, you can read about closures . Deep Dive Each render has its own Effects Show Details You can think of useEffect as “attaching” a piece of behavior to the render output. Consider this Effect: <code_snipet> export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(roomId); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); return <h1>Welcome to {roomId}!</h1>;} </code_snipet> Let’s see what exactly happens as the user navigates around the app. Initial render The user visits <ChatRoom roomId=\"general\" /> . Let’s mentally substitute roomId with \\'general\\' : <code_snipet> // JSX for the first render (roomId = \"general\") return <h1>Welcome to general!</h1>; </code_snipet> The Effect is also a part of the rendering output. The first render’s Effect becomes: <code_snipet> // Effect for the first render (roomId = \"general\") () => { const connection = createConnection(\\'general\\'); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, // Dependencies for the first render (roomId = \"general\") [\\'general\\'] </code_snipet> React runs this Effect, which connects to the \\'general\\' chat room. Re-render with same dependencies Let’s say <ChatRoom roomId=\"general\" /> re-renders. The JSX output is the same: <code_snipet> // JSX for the second render (roomId = \"general\") return <h1>Welcome to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Re-render with same dependencies Let’s say <ChatRoom roomId=\"general\" /> re-renders. The JSX output is the same: <code_snipet> // JSX for the second render (roomId = \"general\") return <h1>Welcome to general!</h1>; </code_snipet> React sees that the rendering output has not changed, so it doesn’t update the DOM. The Effect from the second render looks like this: <code_snipet> // Effect for the second render (roomId = \"general\") () => { const connection = createConnection(\\'general\\'); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, // Dependencies for the second render (roomId = \"general\") [\\'general\\'] </code_snipet> React compares [\\'general\\'] from the second render with [\\'general\\'] from the first render. Because all dependencies are the same, React ignores the Effect from the second render. It never gets called. Re-render with different dependencies Then, the user visits <ChatRoom roomId=\"travel\" /> . This time, the component returns different JSX: <code_snipet> // JSX for the third render (roomId = \"travel\") return <h1>Welcome to travel!</h1>; </code_snipet> React updates the DOM to change \"Welcome to general\" into \"Welcome to travel\" . The Effect from the third render looks like this: <code_snipet> // Effect for the third render (roomId = \"travel\") () => { const connection = createConnection(\\'travel\\'); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, // Dependencies for the third render (roomId = \"travel\") [\\'travel\\'] </code_snipet> React compares [\\'travel\\'] from the third render with [\\'general\\'] from the second render.

Unmount Finally, let’s say the user navigates away, and the ChatRoom component unmounts. React runs the last Effect’s cleanup function. The last Effect was from the third render. The third render’s cleanup destroys the createConnection('travel') connection. So the app disconnects from the 'travel' room. Development-only behaviors When Strict Mode is on, React remounts every component once after mount (state and DOM are preserved). This helps you find Effects that need cleanup and exposes bugs like race conditions early. Additionally, React will remount the Effects whenever you save a file in development. Both of these behaviors are development-only. Recap Unlike events, Effects are caused by rendering itself rather than a particular interaction. Effects let you synchronize a component with some external system (third-party API, network, etc). By default, Effects run after every render (including the initial one). React will skip the Effect if all of its dependencies have the same values as during the last render. You can’t “choose” your dependencies. They are determined by the code inside the Effect. Empty dependency array ( [] ) corresponds to the component “mounting”, i.e. being added to the screen. In Strict Mode, React mounts components twice (in development only!) to stress-test your Effects. If your Effect breaks because of remounting, you need to implement a cleanup function. React will call your cleanup function before the Effect runs next time, and during the unmount. Try out some challenges 1 . Focus a field on mount 2 . Focus a field conditionally 3 .

For example, let’s say you want to filter a list before displaying it. You might feel tempted to write an Effect that updates a state variable when the list changes. However, this is inefficient. When you update the state, React will first call your component functions to calculate what should be on the screen. Then React will “commit” these changes to the DOM, updating the screen. Then React will run your Effects. If your Effect also immediately updates the state, this restarts the whole process from scratch! To avoid the unnecessary render passes, transform all the data at the top level of your components. That code will automatically re-run whenever your props or state change. You don’t need Effects to handle user events. For example, let’s say you want to send an /api/buy POST request and show a notification when the user buys a product. In the Buy button click event handler, you know exactly what happened. By the time an Effect runs, you don’t know what the user did (for example, which button was clicked). This is why you’ll usually handle user events in the corresponding event handlers. You do need Effects to synchronize with external systems. For example, you can write an Effect that keeps a jQuery widget synchronized with the React state.

Your first instinct might be to add a fullName state variable and update it in an Effect: <code_snipet> function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor'); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift'); // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect const [fullName, setFullName] = useState(''); useEffect(() => { setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName); }, [firstName, lastName]); // ...} </code_snipet> This is more complicated than necessary. It is inefficient too: it does an entire render pass with a stale value for fullName , then immediately re-renders with the updated value. Remove the state variable and the Effect: <code_snipet> function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor'); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift'); // ✅ Good: calculated during rendering const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName; // ...} </code_snipet> When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, don’t put it in state. Instead, calculate it during rendering. This makes your code faster (you avoid the extra “cascading” updates), simpler (you remove some code), and less error-prone (you avoid bugs caused by different state variables getting out of sync with each other).

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"to you, Thinking in React explains what should go into state. Caching expensive calculations This component computes visibleTodos by taking the todos it receives by props and filtering them according to the filter prop. You might feel tempted to store the result in state and update it from an Effect: <code_snipet> function TodoList({ todos, filter }) { const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState(''); // 🔴 Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary Effect const [visibleTodos, setVisibleTodos] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { setVisibleTodos(getFilteredTodos(todos, filter)); }, [todos, filter]); // ...} </code_snipet> Like in the earlier example, this is both unnecessary and inefficient. First, remove the state and the Effect: <code_snipet> function TodoList({ todos, filter }) { const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState(''); // ✅ This is fine if getFilteredTodos() is not slow. const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter); // ...} </code_snipet> Usually, this code is fine! But maybe getFilteredTodos() is slow or you have a lot of todos . In that case you don’t want to recalculate getFilteredTodos() if some unrelated state variable like newTodo has changed. You can cache (or “memoize” ) an expensive calculation by wrapping it in a useMemo Hook: <code_snipet> import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';function TodoList({ todos, filter }) { const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState(''); const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => { // ✅ Does not re-run unless todos or filter change return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter); }, [todos, filter]); // ...} </code_snipet> Or, written as a single line: <code_snipet> import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';function TodoList({ todos, filter }) { const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState(''); // ✅ Does not re-run getFilteredTodos() unless todos or filter change const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => getFilteredTodos(todos, filter), [todos, filter]); // ...} </code_snipet> This tells React that you don’t want the inner function to re-run unless either\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"change const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => getFilteredTodos(todos, filter), [todos, filter]); // ...} </code_snipet> This tells React that you don’t want the inner function to re-run unless either todos or filter have changed. React will remember the return value of getFilteredTodos() during the initial render. During the next renders, it will check if todos or filter are different. If they’re the same as last time, useMemo will return the last result it has stored. But if they are different, React will call the inner function again (and store its result). The function you wrap in useMemo runs during rendering, so this only works for pure calculations. Deep Dive How to tell if a calculation is expensive? Show Details In general, unless you’re creating or looping over thousands of objects, it’s probably not expensive. If you want to get more confidence, you can add a console log to measure the time spent in a piece of code: <code_snipet> console.time('filter array');const visibleTodos = getFilteredTodos(todos, filter);console.timeEnd('filter array'); </code_snipet> Perform the interaction you’re measuring (for example, typing into the input). You will then see logs like filter array: 0.15ms in your console. If the overall logged time adds up to a significant amount (say, 1ms or more), it might make sense to memoize that calculation. As an experiment, you can then wrap the calculation in useMemo to verify whether the total logged time has decreased for that interaction or not: <code_snipet> console.time('filter array');const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => { return getFilteredTodos(todos, filter); // Skipped if todos and filter haven't changed}, [todos, filter]);console.timeEnd('filter array'); </code_snipet> useMemo won’t make the first render faster. It only helps you skip unnecessary work on updates. Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users’ so it’s a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown.

Keep in mind that your machine is probably faster than your users’ so it’s a good idea to test the performance with an artificial slowdown. For example, Chrome offers a CPU Throttling option for this. Also note that measuring performance in development will not give you the most accurate results. (For example, when Strict Mode is on, you will see each component render twice rather than once.) To get the most accurate timings, build your app for production and test it on a device like your users have. Resetting all state when a prop changes This ProfilePage component receives a userId prop. The page contains a comment input, and you use a comment state variable to hold its value. One day, you notice a problem: when you navigate from one profile to another, the comment state does not get reset. As a result, it’s easy to accidentally post a comment on a wrong user’s profile. To fix the issue, you want to clear out the comment state variable whenever the userId changes: <code_snipet> export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) { const [comment, setComment] = useState(''); // 🔴 Avoid: Resetting state on prop change in an Effect useEffect(() => { setComment(''); }, [userId]); // ...} </code_snipet> This is inefficient because ProfilePage and its children will first render with the stale value, and then render again. It is also complicated because you’d need to do this in every component that has some state inside ProfilePage . For example, if the comment UI is nested, you’d want to clear out nested comment state too. Instead, you can tell React that each user’s profile is conceptually a different profile by giving it an explicit key. Split your component in two and pass a key attribute from the outer component to the inner one: <code_snipet> export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) { return ( <Profile userId={userId} key={userId} /> );}function Profile({ userId }) { // ✅ This and any other state below will reset on key change\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) { return ( <Profile userId={userId} key={userId} /> );}function Profile({ userId }) { // ✅ This and any other state below will reset on key change automatically const [comment, setComment] = useState(''); // ...} </code_snipet> Normally, React preserves the state when the same component is rendered in the same spot. By passing userId as a key to the Profile component, you’re asking React to treat two Profile components with different userId as two different components that should not share any state. Whenever the key (which you’ve set to userId ) changes, React will recreate the DOM and reset the state of the Profile component and all of its children. Now the comment field will clear out automatically when navigating between profiles. Note that in this example, only the outer ProfilePage component is exported and visible to other files in the project. Components rendering ProfilePage don’t need to pass the key to it: they pass userId as a regular prop. The fact ProfilePage passes it as a key to the inner Profile component is an implementation detail. Adjusting some state when a prop changes Sometimes, you might want to reset or adjust a part of the state on a prop change, but not all of it. This List component receives a list of items as a prop, and maintains the selected item in the selection state variable. You want to reset the selection to null whenever the items prop receives a different array: <code_snipet> function List({ items }) { const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false); const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null); // 🔴 Avoid: Adjusting state on prop change in an Effect useEffect(() => { setSelection(null); }, [items]); // ...} </code_snipet> This, too, is not ideal. Every time the items change, the List and its child components will render with a stale selection value at first. Then React will update the DOM and run the Effects. Finally, the setSelection(null) call will cause another re-render\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='List and its child components will render with a stale selection value at first. Then React will update the DOM and run the Effects. Finally, the setSelection(null) call will cause another re-render of the List and its child components, restarting this whole process again. Start by deleting the Effect. Instead, adjust the state directly during rendering: <code_snipet> function List({ items }) { const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false); const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null); // Better: Adjust the state while rendering const [prevItems, setPrevItems] = useState(items); if (items !== prevItems) { setPrevItems(items); setSelection(null); } // ...} </code_snipet> Storing information from previous renders like this can be hard to understand, but it’s better than updating the same state in an Effect. In the above example, setSelection is called directly during a render. React will re-render the List immediately after it exits with a return statement. React has not rendered the List children or updated the DOM yet, so this lets the List children skip rendering the stale selection value. When you update a component during rendering, React throws away the returned JSX and immediately retries rendering. To avoid very slow cascading retries, React only lets you update the same component’s state during a render. If you update another component’s state during a render, you’ll see an error. A condition like items !== prevItems is necessary to avoid loops. You may adjust state like this, but any other side effects (like changing the DOM or setting timeouts) should stay in event handlers or Effects to keep components pure. Although this pattern is more efficient than an Effect, most components shouldn’t need it either. No matter how you do it, adjusting state based on props or other state makes your data flow more difficult to understand and debug. Always check whether you can reset all state with a key or calculate everything during rendering instead. For'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"on props or other state makes your data flow more difficult to understand and debug. Always check whether you can reset all state with a key or calculate everything during rendering instead. For example, instead of storing (and resetting) the selected item , you can store the selected item ID: <code_snipet> function List({ items }) { const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false); const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null); // ✅ Best: Calculate everything during rendering const selection = items.find(item => item.id === selectedId) ?? null; // ...} </code_snipet> Now there is no need to “adjust” the state at all. If the item with the selected ID is in the list, it remains selected. If it’s not, the selection calculated during rendering will be null because no matching item was found. This behavior is different, but arguably better because most changes to items preserve the selection. Sharing logic between event handlers Let’s say you have a product page with two buttons (Buy and Checkout) that both let you buy that product. You want to show a notification whenever the user puts the product in the cart. Calling showNotification() in both buttons’ click handlers feels repetitive so you might be tempted to place this logic in an Effect: <code_snipet> function ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) { // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect useEffect(() => { if (product.isInCart) { showNotification(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`); } }, [product]); function handleBuyClick() { addToCart(product); } function handleCheckoutClick() { addToCart(product); navigateTo('/checkout'); } // ...} </code_snipet> This Effect is unnecessary. It will also most likely cause bugs. For example, let’s say that your app “remembers” the shopping cart between the page reloads. If you add a product to the cart once and refresh the page, the notification will appear again. It will keep appearing every time you refresh that product’s page. This is because\"),\n",

It will keep appearing every time you refresh that product’s page. This is because product.isInCart will already be true on the page load, so the Effect above will call showNotification() . When you’re not sure whether some code should be in an Effect or in an event handler, ask yourself why this code needs to run. Use Effects only for code that should run because the component was displayed to the user. In this example, the notification should appear because the user pressed the button , not because the page was displayed! Delete the Effect and put the shared logic into a function called from both event handlers: <code_snipet> function ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) { // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is called from event handlers function buyProduct() { addToCart(product); showNotification(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`); } function handleBuyClick() { buyProduct(); } function handleCheckoutClick() { buyProduct(); navigateTo('/checkout'); } // ...} </code_snipet> This both removes the unnecessary Effect and fixes the bug. Sending a POST request This Form component sends two kinds of POST requests. It sends an analytics event when it mounts. When you fill in the form and click the Submit button, it will send a POST request to the /api/register endpoint: <code_snipet> function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(''); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(''); // ✅ Good: This logic should run because the component was displayed useEffect(() => { post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_form' }); }, []); // 🔴 Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect const [jsonToSubmit, setJsonToSubmit] = useState(null); useEffect(() => { if (jsonToSubmit !== null) { post('/api/register', jsonToSubmit); } }, [jsonToSubmit]); function handleSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); setJsonToSubmit({ firstName, lastName }); } // ...}\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"=> { if (jsonToSubmit !== null) { post('/api/register', jsonToSubmit); } }, [jsonToSubmit]); function handleSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); setJsonToSubmit({ firstName, lastName }); } // ...} </code_snipet> Let’s apply the same criteria as in the example before. The analytics POST request should remain in an Effect. This is because the reason to send the analytics event is that the form was displayed. (It would fire twice in development, but see here for how to deal with that.) However, the /api/register POST request is not caused by the form being displayed . You only want to send the request at one specific moment in time: when the user presses the button. It should only ever happen on that particular interaction . Delete the second Effect and move that POST request into the event handler: <code_snipet> function Form() { const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(''); const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(''); // ✅ Good: This logic runs because the component was displayed useEffect(() => { post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_form' }); }, []); function handleSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); // ✅ Good: Event-specific logic is in the event handler post('/api/register', { firstName, lastName }); } // ...} </code_snipet> When you choose whether to put some logic into an event handler or an Effect, the main question you need to answer is what kind of logic it is from the user’s perspective. If this logic is caused by a particular interaction, keep it in the event handler. If it’s caused by the user seeing the component on the screen, keep it in the Effect. Chains of computations Sometimes you might feel tempted to chain Effects that each adjust a piece of state based on other state: <code_snipet> function Game() { const [card, setCard] = useState(null); const [goldCardCount, setGoldCardCount] = useState(0); const [round, setRound] = useState(1); const [isGameOver, setIsGameOver] = useState(false); // 🔴 Avoid: Chains of Effects that adjust the state solely to\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"setGoldCardCount] = useState(0); const [round, setRound] = useState(1); const [isGameOver, setIsGameOver] = useState(false); // 🔴 Avoid: Chains of Effects that adjust the state solely to trigger each other useEffect(() => { if (card !== null && card.gold) { setGoldCardCount(c => c + 1); } }, [card]); useEffect(() => { if (goldCardCount > 3) { setRound(r => r + 1) setGoldCardCount(0); } }, [goldCardCount]); useEffect(() => { if (round > 5) { setIsGameOver(true); } }, [round]); useEffect(() => { alert('Good game!'); }, [isGameOver]); function handlePlaceCard(nextCard) { if (isGameOver) { throw Error('Game already ended.'); } else { setCard(nextCard); } } // ... </code_snipet> There are two problems with this code. The first problem is that it is very inefficient: the component (and its children) have to re-render between each set call in the chain. In the example above, in the worst case ( setCard → render → setGoldCardCount → render → setRound → render → setIsGameOver → render) there are three unnecessary re-renders of the tree below. The second problem is that even if it weren’t slow, as your code evolves, you will run into cases where the “chain” you wrote doesn’t fit the new requirements. Imagine you are adding a way to step through the history of the game moves. You’d do it by updating each state variable to a value from the past. However, setting the card state to a value from the past would trigger the Effect chain again and change the data you’re showing. Such code is often rigid and fragile. In this case, it’s better to calculate what you can during rendering, and adjust the state in the event handler: <code_snipet> function Game() { const [card, setCard] = useState(null); const [goldCardCount, setGoldCardCount] = useState(0); const [round, setRound] = useState(1); // ✅ Calculate what you can during rendering const isGameOver = round > 5; function handlePlaceCard(nextCard) { if (isGameOver) { throw Error('Game already ended.'); } // ✅ Calculate all the next\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"// ✅ Calculate what you can during rendering const isGameOver = round > 5; function handlePlaceCard(nextCard) { if (isGameOver) { throw Error('Game already ended.'); } // ✅ Calculate all the next state in the event handler setCard(nextCard); if (nextCard.gold) { if (goldCardCount <= 3) { setGoldCardCount(goldCardCount + 1); } else { setGoldCardCount(0); setRound(round + 1); if (round === 5) { alert('Good game!'); } } } } // ... </code_snipet> This is a lot more efficient. Also, if you implement a way to view game history, now you will be able to set each state variable to a move from the past without triggering the Effect chain that adjusts every other value. If you need to reuse logic between several event handlers, you can extract a function and call it from those handlers. Remember that inside event handlers, state behaves like a snapshot. For example, even after you call setRound(round + 1) , the round variable will reflect the value at the time the user clicked the button. If you need to use the next value for calculations, define it manually like const nextRound = round + 1 . In some cases, you can’t calculate the next state directly in the event handler. For example, imagine a form with multiple dropdowns where the options of the next dropdown depend on the selected value of the previous dropdown. Then, a chain of Effects is appropriate because you are synchronizing with network. Initializing the application Some logic should only run once when the app loads. You might be tempted to place it in an Effect in the top-level component: <code_snipet> function App() { // 🔴 Avoid: Effects with logic that should only ever run once useEffect(() => { loadDataFromLocalStorage(); checkAuthToken(); }, []); // ...} </code_snipet> However, you’ll quickly discover that it runs twice in development. This can cause issues—for example, maybe it invalidates the authentication token because the function wasn’t designed to be called twice. In general, your components should be\"),\n",

This can cause issues—for example, maybe it invalidates the authentication token because the function wasn’t designed to be called twice. In general, your components should be resilient to being remounted. This includes your top-level App component. Although it may not ever get remounted in practice in production, following the same constraints in all components makes it easier to move and reuse code. If some logic must run once per app load rather than once per component mount , add a top-level variable to track whether it has already executed: <code_snipet> let didInit = false;function App() { useEffect(() => { if (!didInit) { didInit = true; // ✅ Only runs once per app load loadDataFromLocalStorage(); checkAuthToken(); } }, []); // ...} </code_snipet> You can also run it during module initialization and before the app renders: <code_snipet> if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // Check if we're running in the browser. // ✅ Only runs once per app load checkAuthToken(); loadDataFromLocalStorage();}function App() { // ...} </code_snipet> Code at the top level runs once when your component is imported—even if it doesn’t end up being rendered. To avoid slowdown or surprising behavior when importing arbitrary components, don’t overuse this pattern. Keep app-wide initialization logic to root component modules like App.js or in your application’s entry point. Notifying parent components about state changes Let’s say you’re writing a Toggle component with an internal isOn state which can be either true or false . There are a few different ways to toggle it (by clicking or dragging). You want to notify the parent component whenever the Toggle internal state changes, so you expose an onChange event and call it from an Effect: <code_snipet> function Toggle({ onChange }) { const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false); // 🔴 Avoid: The onChange handler runs too late useEffect(() => { onChange(isOn); }, [isOn, onChange]) function handleClick() { setIsOn(!isOn);\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='onChange }) { const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false); // 🔴 Avoid: The onChange handler runs too late useEffect(() => { onChange(isOn); }, [isOn, onChange]) function handleClick() { setIsOn(!isOn); } function handleDragEnd(e) { if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) { setIsOn(true); } else { setIsOn(false); } } // ...} </code_snipet> Like earlier, this is not ideal. The Toggle updates its state first, and React updates the screen. Then React runs the Effect, which calls the onChange function passed from a parent component. Now the parent component will update its own state, starting another render pass. It would be better to do everything in a single pass. Delete the Effect and instead update the state of both components within the same event handler: <code_snipet> function Toggle({ onChange }) { const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false); function updateToggle(nextIsOn) { // ✅ Good: Perform all updates during the event that caused them setIsOn(nextIsOn); onChange(nextIsOn); } function handleClick() { updateToggle(!isOn); } function handleDragEnd(e) { if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) { updateToggle(true); } else { updateToggle(false); } } // ...} </code_snipet> With this approach, both the Toggle component and its parent component update their state during the event. React batches updates from different components together, so there will only be one render pass. You might also be able to remove the state altogether, and instead receive isOn from the parent component: <code_snipet> // ✅ Also good: the component is fully controlled by its parentfunction Toggle({ isOn, onChange }) { function handleClick() { onChange(!isOn); } function handleDragEnd(e) { if (isCloserToRightEdge(e)) { onChange(true); } else { onChange(false); } } // ...} </code_snipet> “Lifting state up” lets the parent component fully control the Toggle by toggling the parent’s own state.

Passing data to the parent This Child component fetches some data and then passes it to the Parent component in an Effect: <code_snipet> function Parent() { const [data, setData] = useState(null); // ... return <Child onFetched={setData} />;}function Child({ onFetched }) { const data = useSomeAPI(); // 🔴 Avoid: Passing data to the parent in an Effect useEffect(() => { if (data) { onFetched(data); } }, [onFetched, data]); // ...} </code_snipet> In React, data flows from the parent components to their children. When you see something wrong on the screen, you can trace where the information comes from by going up the component chain until you find which component passes the wrong prop or has the wrong state. When child components update the state of their parent components in Effects, the data flow becomes very difficult to trace. Since both the child and the parent need the same data, let the parent component fetch that data, and pass it down to the child instead: <code_snipet> function Parent() { const data = useSomeAPI(); // ... // ✅ Good: Passing data down to the child return <Child data={data} />;}function Child({ data }) { // ...} </code_snipet> This is simpler and keeps the data flow predictable: the data flows down from the parent to the child. Subscribing to an external store Sometimes, your components may need to subscribe to some data outside of the React state. This data could be from a third-party library or a built-in browser API. Since this data can change without React’s knowledge, you need to manually subscribe your components to it. This is often done with an Effect, for example: <code_snipet> function useOnlineStatus() { // Not ideal: Manual store subscription in an Effect'),\n",

Since this API does not exist on the server (so it can’t be used for the initial HTML), initially the state is set to true . Whenever the value of that data store changes in the browser, the component updates its state. Although it’s common to use Effects for this, React has a purpose-built Hook for subscribing to an external store that is preferred instead. Delete the Effect and replace it with a call to useSyncExternalStore : <code_snipet> function subscribe(callback) { window.addEventListener('online', callback); window.addEventListener('offline', callback); return () => { window.removeEventListener('online', callback); window.removeEventListener('offline', callback); };}function useOnlineStatus() { // ✅ Good: Subscribing to an external store with a built-in Hook return useSyncExternalStore( subscribe, // React won't resubscribe for as long as you pass the same function () => navigator.onLine, // How to get the value on the client () => true // How to get the value on the server );}function ChatIndicator() { const isOnline = useOnlineStatus(); // ...} </code_snipet> This approach is less error-prone than manually syncing mutable data to React state with an Effect.

Read more about subscribing to external stores from React components. Fetching data Many apps use Effects to kick off data fetching. It is quite common to write a data fetching Effect like this: <code_snipet> function SearchResults({ query }) { const [results, setResults] = useState([]); const [page, setPage] = useState(1); useEffect(() => { // 🔴 Avoid: Fetching without cleanup logic fetchResults(query, page).then(json => { setResults(json); }); }, [query, page]); function handleNextPageClick() { setPage(page + 1); } // ...} </code_snipet> You don’t need to move this fetch to an event handler. This might seem like a contradiction with the earlier examples where you needed to put the logic into the event handlers! However, consider that it’s not the typing event that’s the main reason to fetch. Search inputs are often prepopulated from the URL, and the user might navigate Back and Forward without touching the input. It doesn’t matter where page and query come from. While this component is visible, you want to keep results synchronized with data from the network for the current page and query . This is why it’s an Effect. However, the code above has a bug. Imagine you type \"hello\" fast. Then the query will change from \"h\" , to \"he\" , \"hel\" , \"hell\" , and \"hello\" . This will kick off separate fetches, but there is no guarantee about which order the responses will arrive in. For example, the \"hell\" response may arrive after the \"hello\" response. Since it will call setResults() last, you will be displaying the wrong search results. This is called a “race condition” : two different requests “raced” against each other and came in a different order than you expected. To fix the'),\n",

Handling race conditions is not the only difficulty with implementing data fetching. You might also want to think about caching responses (so that the user can click Back and see the previous screen instantly), how to fetch data on the server (so that the initial server-rendered HTML contains the fetched content instead of a spinner), and how to avoid network waterfalls (so that a child can fetch data without waiting for every parent). These issues apply to any UI library, not just React. Solving them is not trivial, which is why modern frameworks provide more efficient built-in data fetching mechanisms than fetching data in Effects. If you don’t use a framework (and don’t want to build your own) but would like to make data fetching from Effects more ergonomic, consider extracting your fetching logic into a custom Hook like in this example: <code_snipet> function SearchResults({ query }) { const [page, setPage] = useState(1); const params = new URLSearchParams({ query, page }); const results = useData(`/api/search?${params}`); function handleNextPageClick() { setPage(page + 1); } // ...}function useData(url) { const [data, setData] = useState(null); useEffect(() => { let ignore = false; fetch(url) .then(response =>'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='function handleNextPageClick() { setPage(page + 1); } // ...}function useData(url) { const [data, setData] = useState(null); useEffect(() => { let ignore = false; fetch(url) .then(response => response.json()) .then(json => { if (!ignore) { setData(json); } }); return () => { ignore = true; }; }, [url]); return data;} </code_snipet> You’ll likely also want to add some logic for error handling and to track whether the content is loading. You can build a Hook like this yourself or use one of the many solutions already available in the React ecosystem. Although this alone won’t be as efficient as using a framework’s built-in data fetching mechanism, moving the data fetching logic into a custom Hook will make it easier to adopt an efficient data fetching strategy later. In general, whenever you have to resort to writing Effects, keep an eye out for when you can extract a piece of functionality into a custom Hook with a more declarative and purpose-built API like useData above. The fewer raw useEffect calls you have in your components, the easier you will find to maintain your application. Recap If you can calculate something during render, you don’t need an Effect. To cache expensive calculations, add useMemo instead of useEffect . To reset the state of an entire component tree, pass a different key to it. To reset a particular bit of state in response to a prop change, set it during rendering. Code that runs because a component was displayed should be in Effects, the rest should be in events. If you need to update the state of several components, it’s better to do it during a single event. Whenever you try to synchronize state variables in different components, consider lifting state up. You can fetch data with Effects, but you need to implement cleanup to avoid race conditions. Try out some challenges 1 . Transform data without Effects 2 . Cache a calculation without Effects 3 .

Learn React Escape Hatches Lifecycle of Reactive Effects Effects have a different lifecycle from components. Components may mount, update, or unmount. An Effect can only do two things: to start synchronizing something, and later to stop synchronizing it. This cycle can happen multiple times if your Effect depends on props and state that change over time. React provides a linter rule to check that you’ve specified your Effect’s dependencies correctly. This keeps your Effect synchronized to the latest props and state.

A component updates when it receives new props or state, usually in response to an interaction. A component unmounts when it’s removed from the screen. It’s a good way to think about components, but not about Effects. Instead, try to think about each Effect independently from your component’s lifecycle. An Effect describes how to synchronize an external system to the current props and state. As your code changes, synchronization will need to happen more or less often. To illustrate this point, consider this Effect connecting your component to a chat server: <code_snipet> const serverUrl = ' ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, [roomId]); // ...} </code_snipet> Your Effect’s body specifies how to start synchronizing: <code_snipet> // ... const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; // ... </code_snipet> The cleanup function returned by your Effect specifies how to stop synchronizing: <code_snipet> // ... const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; // ... </code_snipet> Intuitively, you might think that React would start synchronizing when your component mounts and stop synchronizing when your component unmounts.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Intuitively, you might think that React would start synchronizing when your component mounts and stop synchronizing when your component unmounts. However, this is not the end of the story! Sometimes, it may also be necessary to start and stop synchronizing multiple times while the component remains mounted. Let’s look at why this is necessary, when it happens, and how you can control this behavior. Note Some Effects don’t return a cleanup function at all. More often than not, you’ll want to return one—but if you don’t, React will behave as if you returned an empty cleanup function. Why synchronization may need to happen more than once Imagine this ChatRoom component receives a roomId prop that the user picks in a dropdown. Let’s say that initially the user picks the \"general\" room as the roomId . Your app displays the \"general\" chat room: <code_snipet> const serverUrl = \\' ChatRoom({ roomId /* \"general\" */ }) { // ... return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;} </code_snipet> After the UI is displayed, React will run your Effect to start synchronizing. It connects to the \"general\" room: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId /* \"general\" */ }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the \"general\" room connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); // Disconnects from the \"general\" room }; }, [roomId]); // ... </code_snipet> So far, so good. Later, the user picks a different room in the dropdown (for example, \"travel\" ). First, React will update the UI: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId /* \"travel\" */ }) { // ... return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>;} </code_snipet> Think about what should happen next. The user sees that \"travel\" is the selected chat room in the UI. However, the Effect that ran the last time is still connected to the \"general\" room. The roomId prop has changed, so what your Effect did back then (connecting to the \"general\" room) no longer matches the UI. At this'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='that ran the last time is still connected to the \"general\" room. The roomId prop has changed, so what your Effect did back then (connecting to the \"general\" room) no longer matches the UI. At this point, you want React to do two things: Stop synchronizing with the old roomId (disconnect from the \"general\" room) Start synchronizing with the new roomId (connect to the \"travel\" room) Luckily, you’ve already taught React how to do both of these things! Your Effect’s body specifies how to start synchronizing, and your cleanup function specifies how to stop synchronizing. All that React needs to do now is to call them in the correct order and with the correct props and state. Let’s see how exactly that happens. How React re-synchronizes your Effect Recall that your ChatRoom component has received a new value for its roomId prop. It used to be \"general\" , and now it is \"travel\" . React needs to re-synchronize your Effect to re-connect you to a different room. To stop synchronizing, React will call the cleanup function that your Effect returned after connecting to the \"general\" room. Since roomId was \"general\" , the cleanup function disconnects from the \"general\" room: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId /* \"general\" */ }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the \"general\" room connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); // Disconnects from the \"general\" room }; // ... </code_snipet> Then React will run the Effect that you’ve provided during this render. This time, roomId is \"travel\" so it will start synchronizing to the \"travel\" chat room (until its cleanup function is eventually called too): <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId /* \"travel\" */ }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Connects to the \"travel\" room connection.connect(); // ... </code_snipet> Thanks to this, you’re now connected to the same room that the user chose in the UI. Disaster'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='roomId); // Connects to the \"travel\" room connection.connect(); // ... </code_snipet> Thanks to this, you’re now connected to the same room that the user chose in the UI. Disaster averted! Every time after your component re-renders with a different roomId , your Effect will re-synchronize. For example, let’s say the user changes roomId from \"travel\" to \"music\" . React will again stop synchronizing your Effect by calling its cleanup function (disconnecting you from the \"travel\" room). Then it will start synchronizing again by running its body with the new roomId prop (connecting you to the \"music\" room). Finally, when the user goes to a different screen, ChatRoom unmounts. Now there is no need to stay connected at all. React will stop synchronizing your Effect one last time and disconnect you from the \"music\" chat room. Thinking from the Effect’s perspective Let’s recap everything that’s happened from the ChatRoom component’s perspective: ChatRoom mounted with roomId set to \"general\" ChatRoom updated with roomId set to \"travel\" ChatRoom updated with roomId set to \"music\" ChatRoom unmounted During each of these points in the component’s lifecycle, your Effect did different things: Your Effect connected to the \"general\" room Your Effect disconnected from the \"general\" room and connected to the \"travel\" room Your Effect disconnected from the \"travel\" room and connected to the \"music\" room Your Effect disconnected from the \"music\" room Now let’s think about what happened from the perspective of the Effect itself: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { // Your Effect connected to the room specified with roomId... const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { // ...until it disconnected connection.disconnect(); }; }, [roomId]); </code_snipet> This code’s structure might inspire you to see what happened as a sequence of non-overlapping time periods: Your Effect connected to the \"general\" room (until it disconnected) Your Effect'),\n",

When you looked from the component’s perspective, it was tempting to think of Effects as “callbacks” or “lifecycle events” that fire at a specific time like “after a render” or “before unmount”. This way of thinking gets complicated very fast, so it’s best to avoid. Instead, always focus on a single start/stop cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether a component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. All you need to do is to describe how to start synchronization and how to stop it. If you do it well, your Effect will be resilient to being started and stopped as many times as it’s needed. This might remind you how you don’t think whether a component is mounting or updating when you write the rendering logic that creates JSX. You describe what should be on the screen, and React figures out the rest. How React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize Here is a live example that you can play with. Press “Open chat” to mount the ChatRoom component: App.js chat.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; import { createConnection } from \\'./chat.js\\'; const serverUrl = \\' function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>; } export default function App() { const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState(\\'general\\'); const [show, setShow] = useState(false); return ( <> <label> Choose the chat room:{\\' \\'} <select value={roomId} onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)} > <option value=\"general\">general</option> <option'),\n",

In development, React always remounts each component once. React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize by forcing it to do that immediately in development. This might remind you of opening a door and closing it an extra time to check if the door lock works. React starts and stops your Effect one extra time in development to check you’ve implemented its cleanup well. The main reason your Effect will re-synchronize in practice is if some data it uses has changed. In the sandbox above, change the selected chat room. Notice how, when the roomId changes, your Effect re-synchronizes. However, there are also more unusual cases in which re-synchronization is necessary. For example, try editing the serverUrl in the sandbox above while the chat is open. Notice how the Effect re-synchronizes in response to your edits to the code. In the future, React may add more features that rely on re-synchronization. How React knows that it needs to re-synchronize the Effect You might be wondering how React knew that your Effect needed to re-synchronize after roomId changes. It’s because you told React that its code depends on roomId by including it in the list of dependencies: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // The roomId prop may change over time useEffect(() => {'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='you told React that its code depends on roomId by including it in the list of dependencies: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // The roomId prop may change over time useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads roomId connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, [roomId]); // So you tell React that this Effect \"depends on\" roomId // ... </code_snipet> Here’s how this works: You knew roomId is a prop, which means it can change over time. You knew that your Effect reads roomId (so its logic depends on a value that may change later). This is why you specified it as your Effect’s dependency (so that it re-synchronizes when roomId changes). Every time after your component re-renders, React will look at the array of dependencies that you have passed. If any of the values in the array is different from the value at the same spot that you passed during the previous render, React will re-synchronize your Effect. For example, if you passed [\"general\"] during the initial render, and later you passed [\"travel\"] during the next render, React will compare \"general\" and \"travel\" . These are different values (compared with Object.is ), so React will re-synchronize your Effect. On the other hand, if your component re-renders but roomId has not changed, your Effect will remain connected to the same room. Each Effect represents a separate synchronization process Resist adding unrelated logic to your Effect only because this logic needs to run at the same time as an Effect you already wrote. For example, let’s say you want to send an analytics event when the user visits the room. You already have an Effect that depends on roomId , so you might feel tempted to add the analytics call there: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { logVisit(roomId); const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, [roomId]);'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { logVisit(roomId); const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, [roomId]); // ...} </code_snipet> But imagine you later add another dependency to this Effect that needs to re-establish the connection. If this Effect re-synchronizes, it will also call logVisit(roomId) for the same room, which you did not intend. Logging the visit is a separate process from connecting. Write them as two separate Effects: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { logVisit(roomId); }, [roomId]); useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // ... }, [roomId]); // ...} </code_snipet> Each Effect in your code should represent a separate and independent synchronization process. In the above example, deleting one Effect wouldn’t break the other Effect’s logic. This is a good indication that they synchronize different things, and so it made sense to split them up. On the other hand, if you split up a cohesive piece of logic into separate Effects, the code may look “cleaner” but will be more difficult to maintain. This is why you should think whether the processes are same or separate, not whether the code looks cleaner. Effects “react” to reactive values Your Effect reads two variables ( serverUrl and roomId ), but you only specified roomId as a dependency: <code_snipet> const serverUrl = ' ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, [roomId]); // ...} </code_snipet> Why doesn’t serverUrl need to be a dependency? This is because the serverUrl never changes due to a re-render. It’s always the same no matter how many times the component re-renders and why.

After all, dependencies only do something when they change over time! On the other hand, roomId may be different on a re-render. Props, state, and other values declared inside the component are reactive because they’re calculated during rendering and participate in the React data flow.

Reactive values must be included in dependencies: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // Props change over time const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState(\\' // State may change over time useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // Your Effect reads props and state connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, [roomId, serverUrl]); // So you tell React that this Effect \"depends on\" on props and state // ...} </code_snipet> By including serverUrl as a dependency, you ensure that the Effect re-synchronizes after it changes.

Thinking from the component’s perspective, the empty [] dependency array means this Effect connects to the chat room only when the component mounts, and disconnects only when the component unmounts.

What’s important is you’ve specified what your Effect does to start and stop synchronizing. Today, it has no reactive dependencies. But if you ever want the user to change roomId or serverUrl over time (and they would become reactive), your Effect’s code won’t change. You will only need to add them to the dependencies. All variables declared in the component body are reactive Props and state aren’t the only reactive values. Values that you calculate from them are also reactive. If the props or state change, your component will re-render, and the values calculated from them will also change. This is why all variables from the component body used by the Effect should be in the Effect dependency list. Let’s say that the user can pick a chat server in the dropdown, but they can also configure a default server in settings. Suppose you’ve already put the settings state in a context so you read the settings from that context.

Any reactive value can change on a re-render, so you need to include reactive values as Effect’s dependencies. In other words, Effects “react” to all values from the component body. Deep Dive Can global or mutable values be dependencies? Show Details Mutable values (including global variables) aren’t reactive. A mutable value like location.pathname can’t be a dependency. It’s mutable, so it can change at any time completely outside of the React rendering data flow. Changing it wouldn’t trigger a re-render of your component. Therefore, even if you specified it in the dependencies, React wouldn’t know to re-synchronize the Effect when it changes. This also breaks the rules of React because reading mutable data during rendering (which is when you calculate the dependencies) breaks purity of rendering. Instead, you should read and subscribe to an external mutable value with useSyncExternalStore . A mutable value like ref.current or things you read from it also can’t be a dependency. The ref object returned by useRef itself can be a dependency, but its current property is intentionally mutable. It lets you keep track of something without triggering a re-render. But since changing it doesn’t trigger a re-render, it’s not a reactive value, and React won’t know to re-run your Effect when it changes. As you’ll learn below on this page, a linter will check for these issues automatically. React verifies that you specified every reactive value as a dependency If your linter is configured for React, it will check that every reactive value used by your Effect’s code is declared as its dependency.

Verify that the linter error is gone, and the chat re-connects when needed. Note In some cases, React knows that a value never changes even though it’s declared inside the component. For example, the set function returned from useState and the ref object returned by useRef are stable —they are guaranteed to not change on a re-render. Stable values aren’t reactive, so you may omit them from the list. Including them is allowed: they won’t change, so it doesn’t matter. What to do when you don’t want to re-synchronize In the previous example, you’ve fixed the lint error by listing roomId and serverUrl as dependencies. However, you could instead “prove” to the linter that these values aren’t reactive values, i.e. that they can’t change as a result of a re-render. For example, if serverUrl and roomId don’t depend on rendering and always have the same values, you can move them outside the component. Now they don’t need to be dependencies: <code_snipet> const serverUrl = ' // serverUrl is not reactiveconst roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactivefunction ChatRoom() { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared // ...} </code_snipet> You can also move them inside the Effect. They aren’t calculated during rendering, so they’re not reactive: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom() { useEffect(() => { const serverUrl = ' // serverUrl is not reactive const roomId = 'general'; // roomId is not reactive const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared // ...} </code_snipet> Effects are reactive blocks of code.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='dependencies declared // ...} </code_snipet> Effects are reactive blocks of code. They re-synchronize when the values you read inside of them change. Unlike event handlers, which only run once per interaction, Effects run whenever synchronization is necessary. You can’t “choose” your dependencies. Your dependencies must include every reactive value you read in the Effect. The linter enforces this. Sometimes this may lead to problems like infinite loops and to your Effect re-synchronizing too often. Don’t fix these problems by suppressing the linter! Here’s what to try instead: Check that your Effect represents an independent synchronization process. If your Effect doesn’t synchronize anything, it might be unnecessary. If it synchronizes several independent things, split it up. If you want to read the latest value of props or state without “reacting” to it and re-synchronizing the Effect, you can split your Effect into a reactive part (which you’ll keep in the Effect) and a non-reactive part (which you’ll extract into something called an Effect Event ). Read about separating Events from Effects. Avoid relying on objects and functions as dependencies. If you create objects and functions during rendering and then read them from an Effect, they will be different on every render. This will cause your Effect to re-synchronize every time. Read more about removing unnecessary dependencies from Effects. Pitfall The linter is your friend, but its powers are limited. The linter only knows when the dependencies are wrong . It doesn’t know the best way to solve each case. If the linter suggests a dependency, but adding it causes a loop, it doesn’t mean the linter should be ignored. You need to change the code inside (or outside) the Effect so that that value isn’t reactive and doesn’t need to be a dependency. If you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { // ... // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter'),\n",

It’s always worth fixing! Recap Components can mount, update, and unmount. Each Effect has a separate lifecycle from the surrounding component. Each Effect describes a separate synchronization process that can start and stop . When you write and read Effects, think from each individual Effect’s perspective (how to start and stop synchronization) rather than from the component’s perspective (how it mounts, updates, or unmounts). Values declared inside the component body are “reactive”. Reactive values should re-synchronize the Effect because they can change over time. The linter verifies that all reactive values used inside the Effect are specified as dependencies. All errors flagged by the linter are legitimate. There’s always a way to fix the code to not break the rules. Try out some challenges 1 . Fix reconnecting on every keystroke 2 . Switch synchronization on and off 3 .

Unlike event handlers, Effects re-synchronize if some value they read, like a prop or a state variable, is different from what it was during the last render.

Imagine you’re implementing a chat room component. Your requirements look like this: Your component should automatically connect to the selected chat room. When you click the “Send” button, it should send a message to the chat. Let’s say you’ve already implemented the code for them, but you’re not sure where to put it. Should you use event handlers or Effects? Every time you need to answer this question, consider why the code needs to run. Event handlers run in response to specific interactions From the user’s perspective, sending a message should happen because the particular “Send” button was clicked. The user will get rather upset if you send their message at any other time or for any other reason. This is why sending a message should be an event handler. Event handlers let you handle specific interactions: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [message, setMessage] = useState(''); // ... function handleSendClick() { sendMessage(message); } // ... return ( <> <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} /> <button onClick={handleSendClick}>Send</button> </> );} </code_snipet> With an event handler, you can be sure that sendMessage(message) will only run if the user presses the button. Effects run whenever synchronization is needed Recall that you also need to keep the component connected to the chat room. Where does that code go? The reason to run this code is not some particular interaction. It doesn’t matter why or how the user navigated to the chat room screen. Now that they’re looking at it and could interact with it, the component needs to stay connected to the selected chat\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='It doesn’t matter why or how the user navigated to the chat room screen. Now that they’re looking at it and could interact with it, the component needs to stay connected to the selected chat server. Even if the chat room component was the initial screen of your app, and the user has not performed any interactions at all, you would still need to connect. This is why it’s an Effect: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // ... useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect(); }; }, [roomId]); // ...} </code_snipet> With this code, you can be sure that there is always an active connection to the currently selected chat server, regardless of the specific interactions performed by the user. Whether the user has only opened your app, selected a different room, or navigated to another screen and back, your Effect ensures that the component will remain synchronized with the currently selected room, and will re-connect whenever it’s necessary. App.js chat.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; import { createConnection, sendMessage } from \\'./chat.js\\'; const serverUrl = \\' function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [message, setMessage] = useState(\\'\\'); useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); function handleSendClick() { sendMessage(message); } return ( <> <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1> <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} /> <button onClick={handleSendClick}>Send</button> </> ); } export default function App() { const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState(\\'general\\'); const [show, setShow] = useState(false); return ( <> <label> Choose the chat room:{\\' \\'} <select value={roomId} onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)} > <option value=\"general\">general</option> <option value=\"travel\">travel</option> <option'),\n",

Effects, on the other hand, are “automatic”: they run and re-run as often as it’s needed to stay synchronized. There is a more precise way to think about this. Props, state, and variables declared inside your component’s body are called reactive values . In this example, serverUrl is not a reactive value, but roomId and message are. They participate in the rendering data flow: <code_snipet> const serverUrl = \\' ChatRoom({ roomId }) { const [message, setMessage] = useState(\\'\\'); // ...} </code_snipet> Reactive values like these can change due to a re-render. For example, the user may edit the message or choose a different roomId in a dropdown. Event handlers and Effects respond to changes differently: Logic inside event handlers is not reactive. It will not run again unless the user performs the same interaction (e.g. a click) again. Event handlers can read reactive values without “reacting” to their changes. Logic inside Effects is reactive. If your Effect reads a reactive value, you have to specify it as a dependency. Then, if a re-render causes that value to change, React will re-run your Effect’s logic with the new value. Let’s revisit the previous example to illustrate this difference. Logic inside event handlers is not reactive Take a look at this line of code. Should this logic be reactive or not? <code_snipet> // ... sendMessage(message); // ... </code_snipet> From the user’s perspective, a change to the message does'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Take a look at this line of code. Should this logic be reactive or not? <code_snipet> // ... sendMessage(message); // ... </code_snipet> From the user’s perspective, a change to the message does not mean that they want to send a message. It only means that the user is typing. In other words, the logic that sends a message should not be reactive. It should not run again only because the reactive value has changed. That’s why it belongs in the event handler: <code_snipet> function handleSendClick() { sendMessage(message); } </code_snipet> Event handlers aren’t reactive, so sendMessage(message) will only run when the user clicks the Send button. Logic inside Effects is reactive Now let’s return to these lines: <code_snipet> // ... const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); // ... </code_snipet> From the user’s perspective, a change to the roomId does mean that they want to connect to a different room. In other words, the logic for connecting to the room should be reactive. You want these lines of code to “keep up” with the reactive value , and to run again if that value is different. That’s why it belongs in an Effect: <code_snipet> useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect() }; }, [roomId]); </code_snipet> Effects are reactive, so createConnection(serverUrl, roomId) and connection.connect() will run for every distinct value of roomId . Your Effect keeps the chat connection synchronized to the currently selected room. Extracting non-reactive logic out of Effects Things get more tricky when you want to mix reactive logic with non-reactive logic. For example, imagine that you want to show a notification when the user connects to the chat. You read the current theme (dark or light) from the props so that you can show the notification in the correct color: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) { useEffect(() => { const connection ='),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='the current theme (dark or light) from the props so that you can show the notification in the correct color: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.on(\\'connected\\', () => { showNotification(\\'Connected!\\', theme); }); connection.connect(); // ... </code_snipet> However, theme is a reactive value (it can change as a result of re-rendering), and every reactive value read by an Effect must be declared as its dependency. Now you have to specify theme as a dependency of your Effect: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.on(\\'connected\\', () => { showNotification(\\'Connected!\\', theme); }); connection.connect(); return () => { connection.disconnect() }; }, [roomId, theme]); // ✅ All dependencies declared // ... </code_snipet> Play with this example and see if you can spot the problem with this user experience: App.js chat.js notifications.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; import { createConnection, sendMessage } from \\'./chat.js\\'; import { showNotification } from \\'./notifications.js\\'; const serverUrl = \\' function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.on(\\'connected\\', () => { showNotification(\\'Connected!\\', theme); }); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId, theme]); return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1> } export default function App() { const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState(\\'general\\'); const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false); return ( <> <label> Choose the chat room:{\\' \\'} <select value={roomId} onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)} > <option value=\"general\">general</option> <option value=\"travel\">travel</option> <option value=\"music\">music</option> </select> </label> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={isDark} onChange={e =>'),\n",

But since theme is also a dependency, the chat also re-connects every time you switch between the dark and the light theme. That’s not great! In other words, you don’t want this line to be reactive, even though it is inside an Effect (which is reactive): <code_snipet> // ... showNotification(\\'Connected!\\', theme); // ... </code_snipet> You need a way to separate this non-reactive logic from the reactive Effect around it. Declaring an Effect Event Under Construction This section describes an experimental API that has not yet been released in a stable version of React. Use a special Hook called useEffectEvent to extract this non-reactive logic out of your Effect: <code_snipet> import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from \\'react\\';function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) { const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => { showNotification(\\'Connected!\\', theme); }); // ... </code_snipet> Here, onConnected is called an Effect Event. It’s a part of your Effect logic, but it behaves a lot more like an event handler. The logic inside it is not reactive, and it always “sees” the latest values of your props and state. Now you can call the onConnected Effect Event from inside your Effect: <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) { const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => { showNotification(\\'Connected!\\', theme); }); useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.on(\\'connected\\', () => { onConnected(); }); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared // ... </code_snipet> This solves'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='connection.on(\\'connected\\', () => { onConnected(); }); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared // ... </code_snipet> This solves the problem. Note that you had to remove onConnected from the list of your Effect’s dependencies. Effect Events are not reactive and must be omitted from dependencies. Verify that the new behavior works as you would expect: App.js chat.js App.js Reset Fork import { useState, useEffect } from \\'react\\'; import { experimental_useEffectEvent as useEffectEvent } from \\'react\\'; import { createConnection, sendMessage } from \\'./chat.js\\'; import { showNotification } from \\'./notifications.js\\'; const serverUrl = \\' function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) { const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => { showNotification(\\'Connected!\\', theme); }); useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); connection.on(\\'connected\\', () => { onConnected(); }); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); return <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1> } export default function App() { const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState(\\'general\\'); const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false); return ( <> <label> Choose the chat room:{\\' \\'} <select value={roomId} onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)} > <option value=\"general\">general</option> <option value=\"travel\">travel</option> <option value=\"music\">music</option> </select> </label> <label> <input type=\"checkbox\" checked={isDark} onChange={e => setIsDark(e.target.checked)} /> Use dark theme </label> <hr /> <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} theme={isDark ? \\'dark\\' : \\'light\\'} /> </> ); } Show more You can think of Effect Events as being very similar to event handlers.

API Reference Built-in React Hooks Hooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React. State Hooks State lets a component “remember” information like user input. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index. To add state to a component, use one of these Hooks: useState declares a state variable that you can update directly. useReducer declares a state variable with the update logic\"),\n",

For example, your app’s top-level component can pass the current UI theme to all components below, no matter how deep. useContext reads and subscribes to a context. <code_snipet> function Button() { const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); // ... </code_snipet> Ref Hooks Refs let a component hold some information that isn’t used for rendering, like a DOM node or a timeout ID. Unlike with state, updating a ref does not re-render your component. Refs are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. They are useful when you need to work with non-React systems, such as the built-in browser APIs. useRef declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node. useImperativeHandle lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used. <code_snipet> function Form() { const inputRef = useRef(null); // ... </code_snipet> Effect Hooks Effects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code. useEffect connects a component to an external system. <code_snipet> function ChatRoom({ roomId }) { useEffect(() => { const connection = createConnection(roomId); connection.connect(); return () => connection.disconnect(); }, [roomId]); // ... </code_snipet> Effects are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. Don’t use Effects to orchestrate the data flow of your application. If you’re not interacting with an external system, you might not need an Effect. There are two rarely used variations of useEffect with differences in timing: useLayoutEffect fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here. useInsertionEffect fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here. Performance Hooks A common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render. To skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks: useMemo lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation. useCallback lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component. <code_snipet> function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) { const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]); // ...} </code_snipet> Sometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart). To prioritize rendering, use one of these Hooks: useTransition lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it. useDeferredValue lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first. Other Hooks These Hooks are mostly useful to library authors and aren’t commonly used in the application code. useDebugValue lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom Hook. useId lets a component associate a unique ID with itself.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='by a form action Troubleshooting My action can no longer read the submitted form data Reference useActionState(action, initialState, permalink?) Call useActionState at the top level of your component to create component state that is updated when a form action is invoked . You pass useActionState an existing form action function as well as an initial state, and it returns a new action that you use in your form, along with the latest form state and whether the Action is still pending. The latest form state is also passed to the function that you provided. <code_snipet> import { useActionState } from \"react\";async function increment(previousState, formData) { return previousState + 1;}function StatefulForm({}) { const [state, formAction] = useActionState(increment, 0); return ( <form> {state} <button formAction={formAction}>Increment</button> </form> )} </code_snipet> The form state is the value returned by the action when the form was last submitted. If the form has not yet been submitted, it is the initial state that you pass. If used with a Server Function, useActionState allows the server’s response from submitting the form to be shown even before hydration has completed. See more examples below. Parameters fn : The function to be called when the form is submitted or button pressed. When the function is called, it will receive the previous state of the form (initially the initialState that you pass, subsequently its previous return value) as its initial argument, followed by the arguments that a form action normally receives. initialState : The value you want the state to be initially. It can be any serializable value. This argument is ignored after the action is first invoked. optional permalink : A string containing the unique page URL that this form modifies.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"use on pages with dynamic content (eg: feeds) in conjunction with progressive enhancement: if fn is a server function and the form is submitted before the JavaScript bundle loads, the browser will navigate to the specified permalink URL, rather than the current page’s URL. Ensure that the same form component is rendered on the destination page (including the same action fn and permalink ) so that React knows how to pass the state through. Once the form has been hydrated, this parameter has no effect. Returns useActionState returns an array with the following values: The current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed. After the action is invoked, it will match the value returned by the action. A new action that you can pass as the action prop to your form component or formAction prop to any button component within the form. The isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition. Caveats When used with a framework that supports React Server Components, useActionState lets you make forms interactive before JavaScript has executed on the client. When used without Server Components, it is equivalent to component local state. The function passed to useActionState receives an extra argument, the previous or initial state, as its first argument. This makes its signature different than if it were used directly as a form action without using useActionState . Usage Using information returned by a form action Call useActionState at the top level of your component to access the return value of an action from the last time a form was submitted. <code_snipet> import { useActionState } from 'react';import { action } from './actions.js';function MyComponent() { const [state, formAction] = useActionState(action, null); // ... return ( <form action={formAction}> {/* ... */} </form> );} </code_snipet> useActionState returns an array with the following items: The current state of the form, which is initially set to the initial\"),\n",

A new action that you pass to <form> as its action prop. A pending state that you can utilise whilst your action is processing. When the form is submitted, the action function that you provided will be called. Its return value will become the new current state of the form. The action that you provide will also receive a new first argument, namely the current state of the form. The first time the form is submitted, this will be the initial state you provided, while with subsequent submissions, it will be the return value from the last time the action was called.

Hashing static asset filenames guarantees that every distinct build of the same asset will have a different filename. This is useful because it lets you safely enable long-term caching for static assets: a file with a certain name would never change content. However, if you don’t know the asset URLs until after the build, there’s no way for you to put them in the source code. For example, hardcoding \"/styles.css\" into JSX like earlier wouldn’t work. To keep them out of your source code, your root component can read the real filenames from a map passed as a prop: <code_snipet> export default function App({ assetMap }) { return ( <html> <head> ... <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href={assetMap[\\'styles.css\\']}></link> ... </head> ... </html> );} </code_snipet> On the server, render <App assetMap={assetMap} /> and pass your assetMap with the asset URLs: <code_snipet> // You\\'d need to get this JSON from your build tooling, e.g. read it from the build output.const assetMap = { \\'styles.css\\': \\'/styles.123456.css\\', \\'main.js\\': \\'/main.123456.js\\'};app.use(\\'/\\', (request, response) => { const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App assetMap={assetMap} />, { bootstrapScripts: [assetMap[\\'main.js\\']], onShellReady() { response.setHeader(\\'content-type\\', \\'text/html\\'); pipe(response); } });}); </code_snipet> Since your server is now rendering <App assetMap={assetMap} /> , you need to render it with assetMap on the client too to avoid hydration errors.

This early getUser call kicks off the asynchronous database query that occurs while Page is doing other computational work and rendering children. When rendering Profile , we call getUser again. If the initial getUser call has already returned and cached the user data, when Profile asks and waits for this data , it can simply read from the cache without requiring another remote procedure call.

Parameters fn : The function you want to cache results for. fn can take any arguments and return any value. Returns cache returns a cached version of fn with the same type signature.

Note The optimization of caching return values based on inputs is known as memoization . We refer to the function returned from cache as a memoized function. Caveats React will invalidate the cache for all memoized functions for each server request. Each call to cache creates a new function. This means that calling cache with the same function multiple times will return different memoized functions that do not share the same cache. cachedFn will also cache errors.

When calling getUser outside of a component, it will still evaluate the function but not read or update the cache. This is because cache access is provided through a context which is only accessible from a component. Deep Dive When should I use cache , memo , or useMemo ? Show Details All mentioned APIs offer memoization but the difference is what they’re intended to memoize, who can access the cache, and when their cache is invalidated. useMemo In general, you should use useMemo for caching a expensive computation in a Client Component across renders. As an example, to memoize a transformation of data within a component. <code_snipet> \\'use client\\';function WeatherReport({record}) { const avgTemp = useMemo(() => calculateAvg(record), record); // ...}function App() { const record = getRecord(); return ( <> <WeatherReport record={record} /> <WeatherReport record={record} /> </> );} </code_snipet> In this example, App renders two WeatherReport s with the same record. Even though both components do the same work, they cannot share work. useMemo ’s cache is only local to the component. However, useMemo does ensure that if App re-renders and the record object doesn’t change, each component instance would skip work and use the memoized value of avgTemp . useMemo will only cache the last computation of avgTemp with the given dependencies. cache In general, you should use cache in Server Components to memoize work that can be shared across components. <code_snipet> const cachedFetchReport = cache(fetchReport);function WeatherReport({city}) { const report = cachedFetchReport(city); // ...}function App() { const city = \"Los Angeles\"; return ( <> <WeatherReport city={city} /> <WeatherReport city={city} /> </> );} </code_snipet> Re-writing the previous example'),\n",

Another difference from the previous example is that cache is also recommended for memoizing data fetches , unlike useMemo which should only be used for computations. At this time, cache should only be used in Server Components and the cache will be invalidated across server requests. memo You should use memo to prevent a component re-rendering if its props are unchanged. <code_snipet> \\'use client\\';function WeatherReport({record}) { const avgTemp = calculateAvg(record); // ...}const MemoWeatherReport = memo(WeatherReport);function App() { const record = getRecord(); return ( <> <MemoWeatherReport record={record} /> <MemoWeatherReport record={record} /> </> );} </code_snipet> In this example, both MemoWeatherReport components will call calculateAvg when first rendered. However, if App re-renders, with no changes to record , none of the props have changed and MemoWeatherReport will not re-render. Compared to useMemo , memo memoizes the component render based on props vs. specific computations. Similar to useMemo , the memoized component only caches the last render with the last prop values. Once the props change, the cache invalidates and the component re-renders. Troubleshooting My memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments See prior mentioned pitfalls Calling different memoized functions will read from different caches. Calling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache. If none of the above apply, it may be a problem with how React checks if something exists in cache.

If getMetrics is called again with the same data , it will return the cached result instead of calling calculateMetrics(data) again. See more examples below. Parameters fn : The function you want to cache results for. fn can take any arguments and return any value. Returns cache returns a cached version of fn with the same type signature. It does not call fn in the process. When calling cachedFn with given arguments, it first checks if a cached result exists in the cache. If a cached result exists, it returns the result. If not, it calls fn with the arguments, stores the result in the cache, and returns the result. The only time fn is called is when there is a cache miss. Note The optimization of caching return values based on inputs is known as memoization . We refer to the function returned from cache as a memoized function. Caveats React will invalidate the cache for all memoized functions for each server request. Each call to cache creates a new function. This means that calling cache with the same function multiple times will return different memoized functions that do not share the same cache. cachedFn will also cache errors. If fn throws an error for certain arguments, it will be cached, and the same error is re-thrown when cachedFn is called with those same arguments. cache is for use in Server Components only. Usage Cache an expensive computation Use cache to skip duplicate work. <code_snipet> import {cache} from 'react';import calculateUserMetrics from 'lib/user';const getUserMetrics =\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='function DemoProfile() { // ✅ Good: `getUser` will memoize. const user = await getUser(\\'demo-id\\'); return <Profile user={user} />;} </code_snipet> React only provides cache access to the memoized function in a component. When calling getUser outside of a component, it will still evaluate the function but not read or update the cache. This is because cache access is provided through a context which is only accessible from a component. Deep Dive When should I use cache , memo , or useMemo ? Show Details All mentioned APIs offer memoization but the difference is what they’re intended to memoize, who can access the cache, and when their cache is invalidated. useMemo In general, you should use useMemo for caching a expensive computation in a Client Component across renders. As an example, to memoize a transformation of data within a component. <code_snipet> \\'use client\\';function WeatherReport({record}) { const avgTemp = useMemo(() => calculateAvg(record), record); // ...}function App() { const record = getRecord(); return ( <> <WeatherReport record={record} /> <WeatherReport record={record} /> </> );} </code_snipet> In this example, App renders two WeatherReport s with the same record. Even though both components do the same work, they cannot share work. useMemo ’s cache is only local to the component. However, useMemo does ensure that if App re-renders and the record object doesn’t change, each component instance would skip work and use the memoized value of avgTemp . useMemo will only cache the last computation of avgTemp with the given dependencies. cache In general, you should use cache in Server Components to memoize work that can be shared across components. <code_snipet> const cachedFetchReport = cache(fetchReport);function WeatherReport({city}) { const report = cachedFetchReport(city); // ...}function App() { const city = \"Los Angeles\"; return ( <> <WeatherReport city={city} /> <WeatherReport city={city} /> </> );} </code_snipet> Re-writing the previous example'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='// ...}function App() { const city = \"Los Angeles\"; return ( <> <WeatherReport city={city} /> <WeatherReport city={city} /> </> );} </code_snipet> Re-writing the previous example to use cache , in this case the second instance of WeatherReport will be able to skip duplicate work and read from the same cache as the first WeatherReport . Another difference from the previous example is that cache is also recommended for memoizing data fetches , unlike useMemo which should only be used for computations. At this time, cache should only be used in Server Components and the cache will be invalidated across server requests. memo You should use memo to prevent a component re-rendering if its props are unchanged. <code_snipet> \\'use client\\';function WeatherReport({record}) { const avgTemp = calculateAvg(record); // ...}const MemoWeatherReport = memo(WeatherReport);function App() { const record = getRecord(); return ( <> <MemoWeatherReport record={record} /> <MemoWeatherReport record={record} /> </> );} </code_snipet> In this example, both MemoWeatherReport components will call calculateAvg when first rendered. However, if App re-renders, with no changes to record , none of the props have changed and MemoWeatherReport will not re-render. Compared to useMemo , memo memoizes the component render based on props vs. specific computations. Similar to useMemo , the memoized component only caches the last render with the last prop values. Once the props change, the cache invalidates and the component re-renders. Troubleshooting My memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments See prior mentioned pitfalls Calling different memoized functions will read from different caches. Calling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache. If none of the above apply, it may be a problem with how React checks if something exists in cache.
